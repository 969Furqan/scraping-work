From a scientific-cultural perspective, the Master's Degree in Neurobiology provides a solid and in-depth education in the field of Neuroscience. It focuses particularly on the morphofunctional organization of the nervous system, the cellular and molecular correlates of neural functions, and the ways in which these functions are realized at the systemic level, as well as the neurobiological foundations of nervous system pathologies. The course also has a "professionalizing" character, emphasizing the importance of continuous updating and innovative technologies to facilitate the integration of graduates into the job market. Alongside the lectures, students are required to attend a research laboratory to carry out experimental activities, the results of which will be developed into the final thesis.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The master's degree course in Neurobiology will be taught entirely in English. It was decided to proceed with this modification as the use of the English language favors the carrying out of research activities as well as the understanding of scientific literature. International exchanges and collaborations are also facilitated, as is entry into the world of work. Finally, as part of the internationalization process, which represents one of the university's strategic objectives, the provision of the Master's Degree Course in English promotes the arrival of foreign students. The course of study is designed to introduce the student to modern knowledge on the biological bases of the multiple and complex functions of nervous tissue and the brain in particular. This disciplinary field, and the interest it arouses, are currently in rapid expansion, as they are inspired by the desire to fully understand processes of fundamental importance for man, such as perceptive experience, relational life, consciousness and thinking, and the need to reduce the impact of pathologies that compromise these functions. Specifically, the training course aims to provide the student with solid and in-depth knowledge bases on the morphofunctional organization of the nervous system, on the cellular and molecular correlates of neural functions and on the ways in which these functions are achieved at a systemic level, in both physiological and physiological conditions. pathological. The primary objective of this path will be to bring out the fundamental problems of modern neuroscientific studies (integrated functions, cellular mechanisms, genetic and molecular substrates, neurobiological bases of pathological processes) underlining the importance of multidisciplinary approaches for the progress of knowledge on each of they. Furthermore, the course intends to highlight the ways in which experimental and applied neurobiological research is conducted, its recent trends and the advanced technologies it uses and the applications of neurobiological knowledge and techniques in the industrial, bio-health, bioinformatician. In accordance with these aims, the educational offer includes training activities in the following fundamental areas of neurobiological investigation: 1) neuromorphological disciplines and cellular and developmental neurobiology; 2) neurophysiological and neurobehavioral disciplines; 3) neuropharmacological disciplines; 4) neurogenetic-molecular disciplines; 5) neurological and neuropathological disciplines; 6) Bioinformatics disciplines. In addition to the classic cycles of lectures, the training objectives will be pursued by also using the following additional tools: 1) mandatory laboratory activities associated with the main courses; 2) exercises carried out using IT tools (e.g. modeling of ion channels, single neurons, synaptic activity, neural networks); 3) demonstrations relating to diagnostic and experimental investigation techniques (e.g. MRI, clinical neurophysiopathology techniques) at institutions (e.g. IRCCS) with which there are collaborations; 4) assignment, as the subject of monographic reading, of original research articles to be presented and subsequently discussed in the form of a journal club; 5) creation of series of seminars, to be proposed as activities of your choice, to which leading researchers active in various fields of neuroscientific research will be invited as speakers.
Career opportunities
Neurosciences are, together with molecular genetic disciplines and cancer research, the sector of biological sciences that has experienced the most rapid development in recent decades. Specific preparation in the neurobiological field therefore offers concrete possibilities for inclusion in work environments that are expected to expand. Universities, hospitals, public and private research bodies, pharmaceutical-biotechnological companies, companies developing and selling biomedical/neurorehabilitation instruments constitute the entry routes into the world of work for master's graduates in Neurobiology. In addition, the master's graduate will be able to enter the sector of educational-informative activities and scientific publishing aimed at disseminating knowledge on the nervous system and the biological foundations of neural functions, in the management of research projects and philanthropic activities of institutions both public and private.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the master's degree course in "Neurobiology", the student must be in possession of a degree (including that obtained according to the regulations previously in force in Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires the possession of curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's initial preparation. The required curricular requirements are the degree obtained in classes L-2 Biotechnology and L-13 Biological Sciences pursuant to Ministerial Decree. 270/2004 and in classes 01 Biotechnology and 12 Biological Sciences established according to the previous teaching system ex Ministerial Decree. 509/99 or in another class. In the latter case, the possession of at least 30 CFU in the SSDs: BIO/06 will be required; BIO/09; ORGANIC/11; ORGANIC/14; ORGANIC/18. Adequate personal preparation will be verified through specific methods regulated within the course teaching regulations. Finally, to access the Master's degree course, the student must be able to use the English language fluently (level B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference for the knowledge of languages), in written and oral form, also with reference to disciplinary lexicons.
