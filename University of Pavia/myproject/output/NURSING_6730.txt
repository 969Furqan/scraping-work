Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
Graduates of the nursing degree are those healthcare workers who independently carry out activities aimed at the prevention, treatment and safeguard of both individual and collective health, performing the tasks identified by institutional regulations relative to the professional profile, as well as by the code of ethics.  The course implements methodologies aimed at setting objectives for assistance throughout the developmental, adult and geriatric stages.
Graduates possess a sound preparation in the fundamental disciplines allowing them not only to collaborate successfully with other healthcare professionals but also to gain a better understanding of the most important core elements of physiological and pathological processes they will be dealing with.
Students are required to have a good command of the English language relevant to their field of studies in particular with regards to a successful exchange of information.
Career opportunities
Nursing is a profession within the healthcare sector focused on providing general, technical, relational and educational assistance to developmental, adult and geriatric stages, regarding aspects of prevention, treatment, palliative care and rehabilitation.  The main tasks are the prevention of disease, patient care for the sick or disabled and healthcare education.
The qualification achieved on conclusion of the course by successfully passing the final exam is a recognised nursing qualification and allows graduates to work within a variety of settings, in public or private healthcare structures both locally or carrying out home visits, as an employee or freelance.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, the student must have a high school diploma, required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission to the degree course is limited by the access planning at national level (Law 2 August 1999, n. 264). Admission takes place through a competitive test; the date and methods of carrying out this test are defined annually by the Ministry of Education, University and Research and published in a specific notice issued by the University. Students admitted to the degree course with a grade lower than a pre-established minimum threshold may be assigned specific additional training obligations; the methods for making up for any training deficits, to be filled in any case within the first year of the course, are governed by the teaching regulations of the degree course.
