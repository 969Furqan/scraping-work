The Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry provides graduates with a solid foundational education, which is open both to the continuation of studies in a Master's Degree, including those aimed at excellence, and to entry into the job market. Building on a strong preparation in mathematics and physics, the four core chemistry disciplines (Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, General and Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry) are each organized into two years of theoretical courses, supplemented by laboratory exercises, which ensure that graduates have a good level of experimental skills and familiarity with chemical methodologies, instrumentation, and laboratory issues. This contributes to the development of professional skills that are directly applicable in the job market. All students, especially those who do not intend to continue their studies, can enhance their professional skills by completing the internship period provided in the educational plan entirely at laboratories of external entities or companies.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The main objective of this programme is to produce graduates with the ability and basic chemical knowledge to work in areas that require familiarity with the scientific method, the capacity to apply innovative methods and techniques, and to use complex equipment.  The competencies acquired will allow the graduate to adapt to the evolution of the discipline, to interact in similar professional fields, and to continue his studies at the Masters level. The curriculum conforms to both the Chemistry Eurobachelor and the model devised by the Italian Chemistry Society regarding the Core Chemistry courses for the L-27 class of degrees.In line with these objectives, a large part of the curriculum is the same for all students and involves knowledge required for the basic areas of chemistry.  The focus is on the well-established knowledge in this discipline adapted to its more advanced developments and in connection with related disciplines. There are some required courses along with credits from electives (see Art. 10, part 5 (a) of the DM 270/2004), which permits the student to personalize his curriculum in areas of proven validity.The basic courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry aim to: - fill possible academic shortcomings from pre-university studies;- accustom the student to frame and solve problems using scientific rigor, in part with the aid of computer tools;- introduce the principles of chemistry with particular reference to the interactions between atoms and molecules;- provide the basic knowledge needed to understand the processes that occur in chemical systems and to carry out calculations and develop models.The specific objectives of the curriculum for personalizing the course of studies in areas of proven validity are:- To provide a solid basis and broad knowledge of the principles of inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, organic chemistry and analytical chemistry;- Provide abilities and competencies in basic laboratory operations;- Create the capacity to appropriately choose and adopt experimental methods, and to gather and analyse data;- Make the student aware of the potential, limits, reliability and fields of application of scientific instruments for, among others, analytical, structural, kinetic and thermodynamic investigations;- Provide knowledge and competencies, in the areas of synthesis and reactivity, of the chemistry and technological features of plastic materials and of the solid state in general.
Career opportunities
The graduate can enter the profession, carry out the relative functions, and find employment in the sectors as indicated below:Profession:Junior ChemistFunctions: - assist specialists in their chemical research or activities requiring the application of chemical procedures and protocols;- as part of service activities, to apply defined and predetermined protocols and  well-established knowledge;- as part of a pre-established programme and under the direction of a Senior Chemist, to carry out laboratory tests for the development of new products.  To characterize new products and help in the experimentation of new technologies;- on the basis of product specifications, to undertake chemical analyses and quality controls requiring the mastery of chemical techniques and instruments at time complex.  Write reports on the results of the analyses;- use standardized methodologies such as: all types of chemical analyses; running chemical labs; consultancy and opinions on pure and applied chemistry; any other activity allowed under current law regarding the chemical profession;- dealing with client requests and advising clients about how to use products.  Matching clientsâ€™ needs with the development, production and marketing of  products in laboratories.Employment sectors:1. public and private research organizations.2. laboratories for analysis, control and quality certification.3. Working as an employee or free-lance consultant in agencies and public and/or private companies.4.  Working in industries and work environments requiring a basic knowledge of chemistry.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the bachelor's degree program, students must hold a high school diploma as required by current regulations, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent authorities of the University. Additionally, admission requires adequate initial preparation, including knowledge of chemistry, physics, and mathematics at the high school level. The methods for verifying the adequacy of the initial preparation and for addressing any gaps or educational deficits in the student's knowledge (to be remedied within the first year of studies) are governed by the Didactic Regulations of the degree program.
