Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The aim of the degree course in Legal Service Science (degree class L-14) is to provide students with a sound knowledge in core legal subjects, which will enable them to immediately acquire the tools to know, understand and think critically about legal texts i.e. laws, case law and scholarly literature. However, they will also develop a critical attitude and an independent mind towards them. This approach forms the very essence of this vocational degree course. The subjects taught in the 1st year, which by law are common to the five-year law degree course, give both a technical and cultural legal grounding. They aim to provide students, who are often approaching law for the first time, with the essential legal concepts and terminology, as well as develop their learning skills and awareness of how legal systems and sources evolve, also in relation to knowledge in the fields of history, philosophy, economics and linguistics. The subjects taught in the 2nd and 3rd years equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary, also in IT, to handle all aspects of their future jobs, ensuring, on the one hand, that they have a solid grounding in fundamental legal areas (public law, private law, international law and Community law), and, on the other, giving them a flexibility of knowledge of specific areas that is of immediate practical application. They also learn the communication skills needed in their future professions and, more generally, in the world of work. In order to provide a more vocationally-oriented education, as per the goals of the degree course in  Legal Service Science, the courses offered in the second and third year provide students with the specific abilities to work either as legal advisers (also at an international level) in private law, labour law and business law (Economic analysis of law, Banking law, International commercial law, Law of labour contracts, Law of torts, Commercial criminal law, Intellectual property and competition law, Regional law, Tax law, Urban law, Political Economy or Finance, Economic elements in accounting, Business Administration, Economics of money and financial markets, Economics and Business Management, Economics and industrial organisation, Business Finance, Human Resource Management, Statistics), or to work as judicial advisers in the court service and in public economy sectors and national and local administrations (Law of labour contracts, Law of torts, Law of corrections, Bankruptcy law, Regional law, Urban Law, Political Economy or Finance, Elements of economics and accounting; Financial reporting of territorial public agencies, Economics of public enterprises, Statistics). Special attention is given to the learning of the English language, and its legal terminology, as well as the acquisition of the technical and legal competences in communication and information management through the use of IT and telematic tools and methods. 6 credits are awarded for internships to acquire professional experience in private and public enterprise, in national and local public administration bodies and agencies, in the court service or law firms, law enforcement agencies and non-profit organisations. A maximum of 6 credits may also be awarded for previously acquired and certified solid legal knowledge and professional skills.
Career opportunities
Career opportunities are essentially as legal consultants in public and private enterprise (administration, contracts, industrial relations, taxation rules etc.) and judicial advisers (in the public sector - court clerk, officers of the court, law enforcement officers; in the private sector - legal clerks and notary clerks).
Admission requirements
The possession of a high school diploma or other qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable according to current laws, is required. Please refer to the Educational Regulations of the study course for the specification of further knowledge necessary for access to the degree course and the definition of the obligations envisaged in the event of an unsuccessful assessment. The Faculty will activate intensive assistance and tutoring services for first-year students, also aimed at facilitating the overcoming of any educational deficits.
