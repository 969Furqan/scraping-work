Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The Masters degree seeks to produce professionals with in-depth knowledge of the theoretical and applied aspects of the basic engineering disciplines in this field. Graduates will be capable of identifying, interpreting, formulating and solving the main (even complex) problems requiring an interdisciplinary and innovative approach typical of environmental engineering. The courses, which give particular importance to methodological aspects, are structured so as to provide advanced engineering skills to work at a highly qualified professional level in the following fields:
- the planning, design and management of complex water systems;
- the planning, design and management of systems for the hydraulic defense of the territory;- the planning, design and management of water, air and soil purification systems;
- planning and management for the sustainable exploitation of energy resources in the environment and territory;
- the planning, design and management of systems for quality control and monitoring;
- the assessment of the environmental impact and compatibility of engineering plans and works.  
In particular, the curriculum will be differentiated to provide in-depth treatment of parallel but different aspects of environmental engineering:
- territorial topics tied to the planning of hydraulic works for the protection of the territory and to the analysis of pollution and the planning and design of systems for the monitoring and control of environmental quality;
- topics regarding facilities tied to the design and management of complex hydraulic systems and water and soil purification;
- topics relating to energy linked to the planning, design and management of systems for producing energy from renewable sources (hydroelectric, solar, wind and biological) and their integration in the environment;
- management topics connected to the management of the territory and of the environment, the planning of complex territorial systems, the environmental impact assessment of territorial infrastructures. In developing the engineering topics particular importance will be given to the generalization of the theoretical and applied content already presented in the preceding three-year degree programmes in order to ensure a preparation that will not quickly become outdated and that will enable the graduate to confidently deal with new problems as well and provide the means necessary to keep pace with future changes in the field. At the same time, the course offerings will give the student personal experience with experimental investigative instruments (hydraulic, hydrological and environmental quality measurements) and with numerical instruments (simulations of phenomena studied using deterministic and stochastic mathematical models) actually employed in an advanced approach to environmental engineering problems. The curriculum will also provide the student with the necessary legal and economic background needed in his future field of work. Moreover, the Masters degree seeks to provide the academic background necessary for more advanced studies in future (second-level Masters degree and research doctorate).

In order to ensure students correctly use the technical terminology and are accustomed to working and learning in an international context, and to increase the number and frequency of foreign student enrolment, part of the degree programme can be done in English, even including a specially-prepared curriculum.
Career opportunities
The main professional opportunities for the environmental engineer are the following:
- Free-lance activity, either individual or as part of an engineering firm or company, involving the planning, design, overseeing and technical control of public works, as well as consulting, monitoring and environmental impact analysis activities;
- National and international companies that construct and maintain civil works, facilities and infrastructures (water systems, hydroelectric plants, systems for reclamation and flood protection, storage facilities and urban and industrial wastewater treatment plants, solid waste treatment plants);
- Employment in companies, local authorities, consortiums and agencies that oversee works and services (municipal bodies, reclamation and irrigation consortiums, aqueduct consortiums, purification consortiums);
- Employment with professional firms and engineering companies involved in the planning, overseeing and technical control of works, and in evaluating the environmental impact and compatibility of plans and works;
- Employment in public bodies that plan, design and oversee urban and territorial systems (municipalities, provinces, regions, ….);
- Employment in environmental monitoring and protection agencies (environmental agencies, water basin authorities, local health agencies, …).
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the master's degree course in Environmental and Territorial Engineering, the student must be in possession of a degree (including that obtained according to the regulations previously in force under Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a university diploma of three-year duration, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires the possession of curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's initial preparation. Access to the master's degree in Environmental and Territorial Engineering presupposes solid knowledge in engineering disciplines, with good preparation in the basic subjects and specific subjects in the field of hydraulic and sanitary engineering. The teaching regulations of the course of study establish the curricular requirements through the definition of the minimum number of university training credits that the candidate must have acquired in his previous career, with reference to the various training activities envisaged by the current legislation, and to the individual scientific disciplinary sectors and /or to groups of scientific disciplinary sectors. Given the training objectives of the course, these groups of scientific disciplinary sectors include in particular those of hydraulics and hydraulic constructions, sanitary engineering, construction science and technology. The Teaching Regulations also define the level of knowledge required for the English language and the procedures to verify the adequacy of the student's initial preparation with criteria and methods of verification established by the Teaching Council.
