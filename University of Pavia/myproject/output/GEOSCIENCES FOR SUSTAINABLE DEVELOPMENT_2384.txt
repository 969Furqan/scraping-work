The bilingual Master's Degree program aims to train professionals with in-depth interdisciplinary knowledge for:
Environmental management based on the principles of sustainable development.
Sustainable use of terrestrial resources, including energy supply sources.
Understanding and modeling the Earth, including human-induced disturbances, as a necessary foundation for guiding sustainable societal development.
These goals are part of the broader context of ecological and energy transition at the national and international levels, and align with the UN Agenda 2030. The courses are taught in both Italian and English, and the curriculum is structured into three pathways, each with specific objectives and corresponding to particular occupational fields.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The proposed course is an advanced level educational project that updates the current course. In fact, a course of study cannot be a static entity but must evolve over time to train professionals with in-depth interdisciplinary knowledge so that they can face the ever-new challenges that society imposes and enter the constantly evolving world of work, even in positions of responsibility. The proposed project refers to:
- the contribution that geological sciences can make to an environmental management based on the cornerstones of sustainable development, while protecting society from geological risks and the effects of climate change;
- the sustainable use of land resources, including sources of energy supply;
- knowledge and modeling of the functioning of the Earth and its reactions to man-made disturbances as a necessary basis for guiding the sustainable development of human society;
- the ability to describe, monitor, and sustainably manage complex natural systems with regard to geological aspects;
- the definition and management of territorial monitoring systems using technological innovations in the field of remote data acquisition.
The course structure, which may be divided into various curricula, is aimed at producing an in-depth scientific preparation in the disciplines necessary for the treatment of the Earth system regarding its theoretical, experimental, and technical-applicative aspects, as well as an overall growth of awareness, knowledge, and familiarity with the main applications of the Earth Sciences in the different sectors of interest of society, all of which are appropriate to a second level degree. The course of studies is designed to stimulate a multidisciplinary preparation while trying, in accordance with the educational objectives of this class of degree, to encourage contact with the main professional fields comprising the Earth Sciences. The teaching methods of the courses are mainly the conventional ones for geological sciences, such as lectures and exercises, both in the classroom, the laboratory, and in the field. The latter is an integral part of most of the courses offered and constitutes an important completion of the theoretical treatment through the direct observation in nature of geological systems and processes. The course of study provides for a good deal of the courses to be held in English, since the profession of geologist and companies working in the geological field are increasingly international in nature as an inevitable consequence of global economic trends and the evolution of the labor market. Therefore, it is essential that students improve their understanding and use of English, especially in the professional field, through the acquisition of vocabulary specific to the discipline.
Career opportunities
Geologist
Graduates with a Second-Cycle Degree in Science in Geosciences for Sustainable Development can find opportunities with professional firms (geological, engineering, naturalistic), civil engineering companies, Territorial Bodies (Regions, Provinces, Municipalities, Mountain Communities, Natural Parks, Department of Civil Protection), companies active in the energy supply sector, service companies for the exploration and drilling of the subsoil, environmental reclamation companies, renewable energy companies, and industries engaged in the mining and processing of geological materials (production of cement, ceramics, glass). Other professional opportunities involve public research institutes (for example, the National Research Council, the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology), private research bodies, universities, government ministries (for example, the "Environment and Protection of the Territory" and the "Seas, Economic Development, and Infrastructure"), and insurance companies.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the Master's degree course in Geosciences for Sustainable Development, the student must be in possession of a degree (including that obtained according to the regulations previously in force under Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. The student is also required to possess certain curricular requirements and adequate personal preparation. The curricular requirements required are the degree obtained in class L-34 (Geological Sciences) pursuant to Ministerial Decree. 270/04 and in class 16 (Earth Sciences), established according to the previous educational system ex Ministerial Decree. 509/99, or in another class whose training path is compatible. For students who do not come from geological sciences classes, the possession of at least 40 university credits in any scientific-disciplinary sector of the GEO area is required. Furthermore, to access the master's degree the student must be able to use the English language fluently (level B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference for the knowledge of languages), in written and oral form, also with reference to disciplinary lexicons. Its verification methods will be explained in the teaching regulations of the master's degree course. Adequate personal preparation will be verified through specific methods regulated within the teaching regulations of the Course of Study.
