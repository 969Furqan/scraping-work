Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The master's degree course in Finance is offered to students, including foreigners, in possession of a three-year degree, or equivalent qualification, in economic, scientific (mathematics and physics) or technological subjects. The master's degree in Finance aims to offer its students a general education, which includes knowledge of the interpretative models of quantitative finance and mastery of statistical and econometric techniques, with the dual aim of allowing graduates to enter professionally in the most advanced segments of the financial services industry, i.e. those most involved in product and process innovation, and to be able to contribute to the process of change that the digitalisation of the sector imposes on all its operators. The training offered is aimed at the student achieving a high level of specialization in mathematical, statistical and IT techniques applied to financial markets and at acquiring full mastery of the tools to: 1. Determine the value of financial assets consistently with the prices of products traded on the market; 2. Measure the risk of financial products and portfolios with econometric techniques and prepare risk hedging techniques with both static and dynamic optimization tools; 3. Design quantitative tools for optimal portfolio management that are able to merge the information contained in historical data and that implicit in the current evaluation of financial products; 4. Analyze large databases with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The training course is divided into four semesters and takes place entirely in English and is structured as follows: 1. acquisition of the specific knowledge of mathematics and theory of stochastic processes necessary for understanding quantitative finance models; 2. acquisition of knowledge of macroeconomics and economic models for the evaluation of financial assets; 3. acquisition of knowledge of statistics and econometrics for risk assessment and the specification and estimation of models for asset pricing and portfolio allocation; 4. acquisition of skills in the field of programming with Python and Matlab and the simulation of complex systems; 5. acquisition of elements of corporate finance, economics of financial intermediaries and financial market law. The training process ends with the development and discussion of a degree dissertation which will ascertain the student's analytical skills, his ability to express himself in the English language and the ability to tackle complex problems using the theoretical and quantitative tools offered. from the degree course. The thesis may also have as its object the development, within a multinational company, an international institution, or a national and/or international research body, of a project previously agreed between the supervisor designated by the Department and the manager at the host structure.
