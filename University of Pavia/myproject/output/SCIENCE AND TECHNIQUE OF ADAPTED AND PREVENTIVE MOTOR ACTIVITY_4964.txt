Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The main aim of the course is to acquire advanced scientific knowledge in the field of motor activities with special attention paid to prevention and adaptation. The Masters degree course will permit students to learn about what is necessary to attain and maintain the best physical efficiency. The techniques are applicable to subjects of all ages, both in normal subjects and those affected by or with a predisposition to develop pathologies linked to a sedentary lifestyle or who lead unhealthy lifestyles, adapting motor activity to subjects with disabilities or affected by pathologies, including the acquisition of skills aimed at the prevention and rehabilitation through motor activities and cases of childhood and teenage unease. The course will consist in: learning and critically analysing the physio-pathological basis a) of illnesses (hypertension diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome etc) of the main organs of the human body so that they may be prevented with planning of the necessary exercise; b) of the main illnesses that affect children and the elderly so that they may be prevented with planning of the necessary exercise; c) of the main forms of disability so that students acquire the cultural tools to plan motor activity for disabled individuals; learning and critically analysing the possibility of applying the fundamentals of psychology in the maintenance of health; planning, proposing and supervising educational protocols, training and post-rehabilitation recovery through movement; to acquire the methodological tools for establishing collaborations in the field of original scientific research projects oriented to the comprehension of mechanisms by which exercise and sport help prevent illness.

In order to reach these objectives, wide scope will be given to biomedical issues with modules dedicated to the theoretical and practical aspects of the biomedical sector and motor and sport disciplines. There will also be a bias towards the psychological issues over the pedagogic in psychological-pedagogic modules. In particular, motor re-education will be emphasised with teaching about: rheumatic illnesses to prevent limb deformities, modify the evolution of the pathology and improving the quality of life of rheumatic patients (MED/16) and patients who have undergone operations (MED/22); knowledge about the principles of dieting and endocrine-metabolic physiopathology (MED/49); the development of models and technologies for biomechanical characterisations of biological structures and the analysis of the biological-artificial interface, - the foundations for designing biomedical instruments (ING-INF/06 and ING-INF/35). 

To conclude, research methods will also be studied in depth as students are taught the principal statistical-epidemiological methods for planning, handling and interpreting observational and experimental research results as well as notions for the use of software for data collection and analysis (MED/01). The course will be taught by frontal lessons and seminars, technical and practical demonstrations in the field and individual activity-based classes with the use of advanced analysis tools to measure physical fitness, placements in provincial partner organisations who are qualified in the field of prevention, post-rehabilitation and adaption.
Career opportunities
Graduates from the Masters course may find employment in: the planning and realisation of physical activity and sports aimed to prevent illness and improve the quality of life; in post-rehab to maintain physical conditioning; in promoting lifestyles that achieve and maintain psycho-physical well-being for individuals of different ages, genders and in different physical shape; in the prevention and functional rehabilitation of poor posture; in planning, co-ordinating and supervising physical education and sports aimed at promoting community health; in planning, co-ordinating and nurturing physical activity and sports for the disabled or for clinically managed individuals. Graduates may be employed as: instructors and co-ordinators in public and private organisations working in the field of post-rehab recovery (gyms, swimming pools, socio-educational centres, thermal baths, wellness centres, health bodies and socio-pedagogic organisations) in which individual or group courses are run; as instructors and co-ordinators in sports centres and gyms where disabled individuals can exercise; as sports trainers for the disabled; as instructors and advocates of physical education and preventative sports in government, regional, council and administrative bodies concerned with hygiene and health; as consultants working in the professional health field; as instructors and organisers for the promotion of health in children, adults, the elderly and the disabled; in tourist and recreational centres and in psycho-motor education.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the master's degree course, the student must be in possession of a degree (including that obtained according to the system prior to Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires the possession of curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's initial preparation. The required curricular requirements are the degree obtained in certain classes indicated in the Teaching Regulations of the master's degree course and the skills and knowledge acquired by the student in the previous training course, expressed in the form of the number of credits indicated in the same Teaching Regulations. The latter also defines the procedures for verifying the adequacy of the student's initial preparation.
