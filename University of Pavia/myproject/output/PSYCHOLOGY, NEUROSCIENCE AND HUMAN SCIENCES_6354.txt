Psychology, neuroscience and human sciences
The qualifying Master's Degree (MSc) in Psychology, Neuroscience and Human Sciences aims to integrate, in an excellent English-taught program, all the psychological competencies present at the universities of Pavia (University of Pavia and IUSS - School for Advanced Studies IUSS Pavia). In the qualifying Master's Degree program in Psychology, Neuroscience and Human Sciences, knowledge in the psychological and neuroscientific fields is effectively complemented by advanced modules in the human and social sciences.
The Master's program is characterized by extensive collaboration between psychology and the fields of neurophysiology and neuroscience, along with cooperation across various humanistic and social areas. The use of English as the language of instruction and the collaboration between the University of Pavia and IUSS increases the potential to attract international students, offering a broad international perspective.
The integration of the study of psychological processes, the latest neuroscientific discoveries, and topics inherent to the human and social sciences will be a distinguishing feature of this program. The course will enable, through legally prescribed modalities, registration with the Order of Psychologists, allowing full professional practice, as well as the possibility of further psychological studies and training (Master's programs and Advanced Courses, Specialization Schools, PhD programs, Order of Psychotherapists).

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The Master's Degree Course in Psychology, Neuroscience and Human Sciences aims to integrate, in a path of excellence in English, all the skills and knowledge in the psychological and neuroscientific fields, which are profitably supported by in-depth modules in the human sciences and social. The language of instruction - English - offers the possibility of attracting foreign students in a broad international perspective. The degree course is aimed at deepening psychological knowledge and preparing professional figures who can operate in the field of psychological interventions throughout development (with assessment, educational and clinical intervention tasks), in the context of personal and family needs and relationships, in the world of school and work. These training objectives will be achieved through advanced level training in psychological fields to be acquired within the first year of the course, and specific training aimed at acquiring particularly in-depth knowledge to be acquired mostly during the second year of the course as well as through activities included in the practical-evaluative-TPV internship. In particular, the course of study aims to provide in-depth knowledge and train highly specialized professional figures: - in the field of clinical psychology by providing specific knowledge relating to the profound emotional factors of individual development; delving into the aspects of the relational approach, the interview, the evaluation and diagnosis of personal characteristics and the risks and problems connected to the psychological dynamics of the subject. In this case, the main objective is to prepare professional figures capable of evaluating the ways in which psychological well-being functions in relation to the different phases of development and to prepare, therefore, professional figures who will be able to operate in the area of prevention and treatment of psychological distress. - in the field of developmental and orientation psychology, providing in-depth preparation on the mechanisms and problems of development in the various phases of the entire life cycle and in the different contexts of growth (individual, family and scholastic/educational. The skills acquired are functional to the preparation of professionals who operate in services aimed at the person, who can work individually or within the services that operate in the sectors of childhood, family, adolescence, aging and who are able to work in the field of research (applied and otherwise) on neural mechanisms and the cognitive processes associated with them - in the field of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, providing tools and advanced notions of cognitive psychology, aimed at understanding brain functioning, human and comparative neurophysiology, of neuroimaging techniques, artificial intelligence, with attention to possible application areas, including in the evolutionary field and in normal and pathological aging. Tools and techniques for diagnosis and specific intervention will be explored in depth, in the cognitive and metacognitive field, as well as cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation techniques in the clinical field. In this case, the main objective is to train professional figures who can operate in the field of basic and applied research, in hospital and healthcare settings, and in the field of personal services. For the purposes of the above, the master's degree course may be divided into curricula. Specific attention is given to the coherence and synergy between the characterizing theoretical teachings and the professional training activities, with particular reference to the practical evaluation internship (TPV) of 20 ECTS. The practical evaluation internship allows the achievement of skills that can refer to: a) case evaluation; b) appropriate use of psychological tools and techniques for gathering information to carry out an analysis of the case and context; c) preparation of a theoretically grounded and evidence-based professional intervention; d) evaluation of the process and outcome of the intervention; e) drafting a report; f) return to patient/customer/user/institution/organisation; g) establish adequate relationships with patients/customers/users/institutions/organisations; h) establish adequate relationships with colleagues; i) understanding of the legal/ethical/deontological profiles of the profession, as well as their possible conflicts. l) design and implementation of experimental projects
Career opportunities
The Master's Degree in Psychology, Neuroscience and Human Sciences allows, through the methods established by law, registration in the Register of Psychologists and the consequent exercise of the profession, with various types of opportunities in public and private companies (healthcare and otherwise), in personal care and assistance organizations and structures, in scientific research bodies, in the school and training sectors, and in all those institutions that provide consultancy activities in the various areas foreseen by the course of studies followed. The Master's Degree in Psychology, Neuroscience and Human Sciences allows the possible continuation of studies and psychological training in Italy or abroad (Masters and Specialization Schools, Specialization Schools, Research Doctorate).
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the master's degree course, the student must be in possession of a degree (including that obtained according to the regulations previously in force under Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires the possession of curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's initial preparation. The curricular requirements required are the skills and knowledge acquired by the student in the previous training course, in the case of a degree obtained in Italy expressed in the form of a number of credits referring to specific scientific-disciplinary sectors and precisely at least 88 university training credits (cfu) of psychological area (M-PSI sectors). The educational regulations of the course of study define the procedures for verifying the adequacy of the student's initial preparation, with particular reference to the evaluation criteria for students who have obtained their qualification abroad by determining equivalence, for the purposes of enrollment in the course of study, at the 88 credits required for graduates in Italy. To access the master's degree, the student must also be able to use the English language fluently, in written and oral form, also with reference to disciplinary lexicons, with a level of competence at least equal to B2 based on the Common European Framework drawn up by the Council of Europe . The recognition of the 10 TPV credits that can be carried out within the three-year degree may possibly be considered equivalent even in the case of activities carried out within foreign degree programmes. In the absence of recognition, total or partial, of the 10 CFU of TPV, the student will be able to acquire the aforementioned missing CFU during the two-year period, as supernumerary compared to the 120 CFU of the LM.
