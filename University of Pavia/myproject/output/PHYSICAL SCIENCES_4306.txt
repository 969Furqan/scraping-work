Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
Within the scope outlined by the qualifying educational objectives of the class, the Master's Degree Course in Physical Sciences is characterized as the natural continuation of a Degree Course in Physics aimed at providing a solid basic preparation. In addition to completing basic training at a higher level, it intends to provide the student with specific training suitable for carrying out professional activities in various fields related to research, whether fundamental or applied, experimental or theoretical, even in multidisciplinary contexts. The final objective of the Master's Degree Course in Physical Sciences is to provide cultural and methodological training suitable for research activity and immediate entry into the world of work in the traditional sectors of physics graduates or for the continuation of training activity through the Ph.D. Part of the teaching is delivered in English, also in order to accustom students to the language most used in publications and international scientific conferences. Different training courses are offered which lead to specialization in some sectors of physics such as, for example, the physics of matter, nuclear and subnuclear physics, theoretical physics and quantum technologies. At the end of their studies, students will be able to enter the public or private research sector, in companies operating in the energy, nanotechnology, electronics and information technology sectors, which carry out analyzes of the performance of financial markets and activities that require mastery of data analysis. Furthermore, training courses oriented towards teaching and the history of physics are proposed, with the prospect of teaching in secondary schools and connected to the bio-health sector, for those interested in practicing professions that involve the numerous applications of physics in the biomedical field, in hospitals , at public research centers, in the pharmaceutical industry, both for diagnostics, therapy and radiation protection. The Course Regulations explicitly define the different curricula corresponding to the training paths described above and possibly corresponding to further paths whose opportunity may emerge. The Study Course does not include compulsory teaching activities common to the different courses, while, in the case of courses with an interdisciplinary character, courses in SSD not belonging to the area of physical sciences are foreseen. The course of study will be divided into lessons, exercises, practical laboratory activities, activities aimed at entering the world of work and will conclude with the final thesis paper.
Career opportunities
Physicist and similar professions, researchers in Physical Sciences Employment at: 1) research centers and laboratories at public bodies or private companies, including international ones; 2) structures in which skills in modeling phenomena in various fields and/or the creation of complex instrumentation are required; 3) centers and laboratories that require skills in data acquisition and processing; 4) healthcare facilities that require knowledge of techniques for diagnostics, therapy and radiation protection; 5) public or private structures operating in the field of environmental protection and the safeguarding of cultural heritage; 6) research centers operating in the energy, nanotechnology and information technology sectors; 7) banking and insurance research centers; 8) astronomical observatories. Graduates in possession of the credits required by current legislation will be able to participate in the entrance tests for the training courses of teaching staff for lower and upper secondary schools.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the master's degree course, the student must be in possession of a degree (also obtained according to the regulations previously in force under Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires the possession of curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's personal preparation as well as adequate knowledge of the English language (level B2). The curricular requirements required are a degree in class 25 according to the provisions of the former Ministerial Decree. 509/1999, in class L-30 according to the regulations dictated by the Ministerial Decree. 270/2004 or other qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent university bodies. In the case of a degree obtained in classes other than those indicated above, the skills and knowledge acquired by the student in the previous training path will be evaluated and in particular the achievement of training credits in the scientific disciplinary sectors of the FIS/* and MAT/* areas as per indications contained in the Course of Study Educational Regulations. The latter also defines the procedures for verifying the adequacy of the student's personal preparation.
