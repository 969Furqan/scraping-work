The Masterâ€™s Degree in Molecular Biology and Genetics aims to provide advanced training focused on the study of biology at the molecular level.
The program covers both theoretical and methodological aspects related to basic and applied research, with particular emphasis on the latest developments in biomolecular science. Courses are taught in English.
Throughout the two-year course, students will become part of a research group and participate in one of the ongoing projects, with the results used to compile an experimental thesis, which constitutes an essential component of the degree.
The program is divided into two tracks:
Molecular Life Sciences
Molecular and Digital Biology
The courses are designed to deepen knowledge in Biomolecular Sciences, including Biochemistry, Genetics, Molecular Biology, and Microbiology. The curriculum will focus on understanding the relationships between molecular structures and biological functions, as well as exploring Genomics, Proteomics, and their implications in studying biological processes, diseases, and biotechnological applications.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The Master's Degree Course in Molecular Biology and Genetics will be taught entirely in English. The goal is to train students to be capable of competing in the global market. In particular, we aim to facilitate the carrying out of research activities, the understanding of scientific literature, the use of advanced digital tools, international exchanges and collaborations and to attract foreign students as part of the ongoing internationalization process in the University. The Master's Degree in Molecular biology and genetics aims to provide advanced training focused on the study of biology at the molecular level. Theoretical and methodological aspects relating to both basic and applied research will be addressed, with particular attention to the most recent developments in knowledge in the biomolecular field. More specifically, the objective of this Master's Degree is the training of biologist figures who possess specific skills in basic biology and its applications and, depending on the chosen curriculum, molecular and genetic knowledge as well as cellular systems, transversal skills which include both knowledge acquired in the experimental field and specific skills in processing and analysis of omics data and "big data". To achieve the professionalism objectives indicated, it is believed that the cultural path must be characterized by a training offer: - aimed at in-depth study of biomolecular sciences, with particular reference to biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology (including the most recent developments on the relationships of molecular and submolecular structures with biological functions), to bioinformatics, to the progress of omics sciences and their impact on the study of fundamental biological processes; - highly topical and of undoubted interest in relation to the rapid progress in the field of the study of biomolecules, of the properties of microorganisms (useful, pathogenic and non-pathogenic), of the mechanisms that determine the development and differentiation processes of animal organisms, of the methodologies for the targeted manipulation of genomes for cognitive, productive and therapeutic purposes; - capable of creating interdisciplinary professional figures with skills transversal to "wet" and "dry" molecular biology highly requested by the national and international world of work; - characterized by a high number of CFU dedicated to practical and/or laboratory activities closely correlated with both the training activity and the research activities carried out by the course teachers.
Career opportunities
Molecular biologist: The professional fields in which the master's graduate in Molecular biology and genetics will be able to operate are those relating to: - fundamental and applied research activities in public or private laboratories; - big data analysis activities in the corporate and public sector, even outside the strictly biological context; - activities for the dissemination and development of scientific and technological innovation in the molecular-biological field in the most dynamic and critical sectors of society, as well as the management and design of molecular technologies with reference also to their application implications; - educational-informative activities aimed at disseminating knowledge on biological phenomena at all levels; - professional activities related to the exploitation of biomolecular knowledge in public and private laboratories; - professional activity in transversal areas related to scientific writing in English such as specialized scientific publishing, the management of academic and industrial research projects, the coordination, management and monitoring of philanthropic activities within public and private institutions that support fundamental and applied research in biology; - professional activity in the bio-pharmaceutical sector and in the international regulatory field; - access to subsequent training courses; the general biological training and the theoretical/practical specialist training in the biomolecular field prepare the master's graduate in Molecular biology and genetics for access to PhD courses and second level Masters whose curricula prefigure characteristic training areas of the Master's Degree in question, and to qualifying courses for teaching-related professions.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the Molecular biology and genetics master's degree course, the student must be in possession of a degree (including that obtained according to the regulations previously in force in Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires the possession of certain curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's initial preparation. The required curricular requirements are automatically recognized for those who hold a degree obtained in classes 1 (Class of degrees in Biotechnology) and 12 (Class of degrees in Biological Sciences) of the Ministerial Decree. 509/1999 and in classes L-2 (Biotechnology) and L-13 (Biological Sciences) of the Ministerial Decree. 270/2004. Also admitted are candidates who have obtained a degree in classes other than those indicated above, whose educational path has nevertheless allowed the acquisition of: - at least 9 ECTS among the SSD MAT/05, MAT/08, FIS/01, ING-INF/06; - at least 12 credits among the SSDs BIO/06, BIO/09, BIO/10, BIO/11, BIO/13, BIO/14, BIO/18, BIO/19; - at least 9 credits among the SSD CHIM/03, CHIM/06, CHIM/08. Adequate personal preparation in relation to the chosen study curriculum will be verified through specific methods regulated within the study course teaching regulations. Finally, to access the Master's degree course, the student must be able to use the English language fluently (level B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference for the knowledge of languages), in written and oral form, also with reference to disciplinary lexicons.
