Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
Dental hygiene graduates must: - identify the physiopathological foundations of oro-dental diseases; understand the principles of sterilisation, cross-infection prevention and the treatment of patients at risk; recognise the clinical manifestations linked to the course and treatment of the main diseases of the oral cavity and the techniques of fundamental assessment of the stomatologic system: - understand the basics of the pathologies of the oral cavity and the duration and method of an integrated odontostomatologic treatment; - learn how to communicate effectively to motivate and educate patients with regards to the control and removal  of bacterial plaque with a view to preventing, reducing and controlling tooth decay and periodontal disease; - plan and develop primary and secondary prevention aimed at healthy, ill and disabled individuals, both in hospitals and in the community, promoting positive healthy lifestyles and behaviour including diet control and teaching the adoption of self-management systems; - carry out correct use of instruments in the control of bacterial plaque, tartar ablation and root polishing .; - applying sealants to occlusal grooves, perform tooth whitening procedures and polishing fillings; control patient’s dental hygiene before, during and after orthognatodontic treatment; - preventing, dealing with and monitoring critical situations related to the clinical and psychological aspects of the patient in collaboration with other health care professionals; - understand the regulations of forensic medicine, social medicine, health care legislation and organisation regarding the professional role through the definition of priority, the appropriate use of available resources, delegating to collaborators, ensuring professional status and continuity; - identify and plan hygiene and prevention programmes; - using tools and methodologies of assessment and revision of quality standards, - applying research findings to improve the quality of prevention; - act in a manner coherent with the interdisciplinary ethical and deontological principles of the dental hygiene profession applying the relative regulations and taking into account citizens’ rights.

First year course programme : - essential first aid, preventative hygiene and biomedical studies and the professional principles are required in order to participate in the first experience of practical training, dealing with basic skills and guiding the student in the study of oral cavity health and pathology.
Second year programme: - in-depth study of clinical disciplines, methods and techniques in the prevention of tooth decay in children and adults aimed at achieving competence in the practises of plaque and tartar removal both manually and with mechanical tools, and the application of preventative measures. 
Periods of practical training are organised in the department of prevention and dental hygiene and in various hospital wards such as paediatrics, general medicine, radiotherapy and oncology. Here, under tutor supervision, the students apply the methodologies and techniques acquired.
Third year programme: - in-depth study of dental hygiene science in relation to various types of dental patients with particular reference to implant patients and systematic pathologies.
The programme also includes knowledge and methodologies related to professional practice, the skills to successfully work in a team and complex organisational contexts, as well as the methodologies of scientific research.
Career opportunities
The role of dental hygiene graduates ( professional health care qualification in dental hygiene) is outlined in the Ministry for Health Decree of 15th March 1999 n°137, including subsequent modifications and integration. Following indications from dentists and doctors (licensed to practice dentistry) they perform tasks dealing with the prevention of oro-dental disease. Graduates also work in the field of dental healthcare education and take part in primary prevention projects with the National Health Service; they collaborate in the compilation of odontostomatologic medical files and look after registration of technical-statistical data; they provide tartar ablation and root polishing as well as the application of various preventative measures; they provide education concerning the various methods of dental hygiene and the use of diagnostic tools suitable for highlighting bacterial plaque build-up and thus promoting the need for regular check-ups, provide dietary information in order to promote dental health; they may practice their profession in public or private health care institutions, as employees or freelance, as instructed by dentists and doctors (licensed to practice).
