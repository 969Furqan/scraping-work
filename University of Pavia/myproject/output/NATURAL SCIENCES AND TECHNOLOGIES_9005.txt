Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
In line with the goals for this class of programme, the curriculum will closely focus on providing the basic background for this area.  In addition to providing the basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, botany, zoology and ecology, the curriculum will give students the basis for gaining complete familiarity with the scientific method, both as regards the capacity to gather and classify environmental and naturalistic data and its analysis and interpretation. The curriculum is substantially theoretical in nature and thus suited for students who intend to go on to do a Masters degree, in particular in those areas that represent a natural progression (LM 60  Science of Nature, and LM 75  Science and Technology for the Environment and Territory).  However, this does not preclude the graduate immediately entering the working world after graduation in various professional capacities as an analyst dealing with the acquisition and analysis of data from the biotic and abiotic environment.The Natural Sciences traditionally are multidisciplinary, and the relatively wide range of individual disciplines is justified by the fact that the course allows students to direct their university preparation toward studies and applications in the following pertinent sectors: a) the study and conservation of naturalistic resources; b) environmental analysis and the recovery of areas subject to anthropic impact; c) the design and management of green areas.Given these ends, this class of degree programme also includes practical activities in the field and laboratory in order to provide the student with the basic knowledge regarding all levels of biospheric organization:a) the organism, studied at the molecular, subcellular, cellular, tissue, anatomical, physiological and behavioural  level of animal and vegetal models;b) the population in terms of its genetic, ecological and behavioral aspects;c) the community in terms of its vegetal  cenosis and the specific interactions of its zoocenosis;d) the ecosystem.As concerns the geosphere, graduates will have acquired competencies in the fields of geography, geomorphology, geology, paleontology, mineralogy and petrography, and will also be able to recognize disturbances caused by human activity and to formulate appropriate recovery hypotheses.In line with the above objectives, a large part of the curriculum will be common to all students and involve basic courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and geology. The lessons are mainly of the traditional formal variety involving both in class and supplementary lessons, in addition to wide-ranging activities involving lab work, excursions and internships.  The conventional lessons are also complemented by the well-established support of tutored projects involving guided group or individual study.
Career opportunities
The degree in Science and Technology for Nature aims, through a basic scientific-technical preparation, at providing the student with a store of basic knowledge.  Thus the course should be seen as the initial stage of a study path that can lead to a Masters degree and even a research doctorate or go in a teaching direction.  On the other hand, the student who wishes to earn a three-year degree in Science and Technology for Nature can, if he has properly chosen his elective courses, enter into a number of professional areas.Of note is the fact that an effort is currently underway to include the Naturalist profession within the ISTAT codes
