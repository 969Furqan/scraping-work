The five-year course aims to train restorers of musical instruments and scientific instruments, as stipulated by the Ministry of Culture. The restorer is a complex figure who must possess scientific, humanistic, and technical skills. They do not simply perform operations like a technician but design and execute an intervention in every part, utilizing the support of other professionals, such as chemists, physicists, organologists, historians of science, curators, and museology experts. They must be able to communicate with all of them in order to work independently and responsibly.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The single-cycle master's degree course aims at a broad and structured training of the figure of the restorer, combining solid cultural skills in the humanities and science with the development of manual skills and with the awareness of ethical and deontological problems that affect the field of conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. The profile of master's degree graduates corresponds to the professional qualification of Restorer of Cultural Heritage according to art. 29, par. 6,7,8,9 Legislative Decree 42/04 and subsequent amendments. Consistent with this definition and with the profile drawn by the Ministerial Decree 26.05.2009 n. 86 art. 1 co. 1, master's degree graduates will be able to define the state of conservation of cultural heritage and undertake direct and indirect actions to safeguard its cultural value, limiting the processes of material degradation and ensuring its conservation. They will also be able to contextualize the works by understanding their artistic and cultural value. They will be able to operate in full autonomy with respect to the needs set out above.
Master's degree graduates possess specific manual skills and develop high scientific, technical and humanistic skills; know the methodologies and techniques of diagnostics, conservation and restoration; possess basic knowledge of the legislation concerning cultural heritage.
In the design of the course, on the basis of the needs and the specific vocation of the territory, universally recognized for the extraordinary tradition of violin making (recognized by UNESCO as an intangible heritage of humanity) and organ building, and based on the presence of prestigious collections of scientific instruments both in Cremona and at the University of Pavia, it was decided to activate the PFP 6 Musical Instruments,  scientific and technical instruments and instruments.
In the study plan, the basic subjects are equally divided between disciplines for scientific training (General and Inorganic Chemistry; Organic chemistry; Experimental physics; Physics applied to cultural and environmental heritage; Information processing systems; Design and Fundamentals of Computer Modelling) and disciplines for historical and art-historical training (Museology and Art and Restoration Criticism; Archival Studies, Bibliography and Librarianship, History of Medieval Art, History of Modern Art). The characterizing and related subjects maintain the same balance, providing specific in-depth studies regarding the history and methodology of restoration, botany, physics, applied geology and chemistry, materials technology, the history of music, musical instruments and their construction techniques, palaeography and the history of sciences and techniques,  Acoustic Engineering, legislation on cultural heritage, the economic management of a restoration laboratory as dictated by the law establishing the LMR/02 degree class.
Career opportunities
Restorer of cultural heritage
Graduates in Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage can find jobs that match their skills in restoration laboratories and companies; collaborate with institutions of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities responsible for the protection of Cultural Heritage (superintendencies, museums, archives, libraries, etc.): with companies and professional organizations in the sector; with public and private institutions and research bodies operating in the field of conservation, restoration and enhancement of cultural heritage. In particular, graduates who have followed PFP6 will be able to find employment as conservators and restorers of musical instruments, instrumentation and scientific and technical instruments at museums and competent institutions in Italy and abroad.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, students must have an upper secondary school diploma required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission to PFP6 also requires an adequate initial preparation in the humanities and science, as well as basic musical knowledge. It is also essential to possess adequate manual skills in the processing of materials specifically related to the field of musical instruments.
