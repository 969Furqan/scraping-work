The goal of the Bachelor’s Degree is to train a professional in physical activity with a solid cultural foundation and the methodological skills necessary to conduct, manage, and evaluate simple physical and sports programs at both individual and group levels. The educational path, with specific objectives for different training areas, both basic and specialized, is detailed in the study plan.
The training program ensures that students acquire specific knowledge in anatomy, biochemistry, and physical and statistical elements to understand and quantify various biological processes. Additionally, it addresses psycho-pedagogical aspects that can motivate an interest in the body, sports, and physical activities.
In addition to building a solid foundational knowledge of the functioning of the human body in motion and performing morpho-functional assessments, the training focuses on the theoretical, technical, and didactic aspects of motor and sports activities.
Students are required to attend at least 75% of the teaching hours for each course that mandates compulsory attendance, particularly for practical activities, as outlined in the academic regulations of the Bachelor’s Degree program.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The relationship between the faculties that participate in this degree course, Medicine & Surgery and Engineering is fundamental due to a long traditions of excellence in the study of human movement. The research groups have international experience in the study of the cellular mechanism of muscles and bones, the motor performance, the nervous system and the neuro-muscular plasticity in normal and pathological conditions, during treatment and recuperation. Research teams works both on cells, in normal subjects as well as those affected by central and peripheral nervous diseases and through applied research with the development of evaluational protocols and values. The bioengineering team works on methodologies, technologies and experimental competences in the fields on movement and motor co-ordination. This relates to planning and development of instruments for motor analysis, to the evaluation of rehabilitative processes and to the development of techniques and tools useful in motor behaviour management of disabled. In the first year, students will study anatomy, biochemistry and physiology to understand how human body movement works and how history and society have been able to bring increased attention to the body and to sport and motor activity. During the first year students experience basic practice in one or more motor and sports disciplines. The second year is focused on the teaching of motor activity and sport, concentrating on sports and the link between motor activity and health. Special attention is paid to link between health and motor activities and sport, the individual development through life stages and to teaching methods of motor activity and sport. Here students may specialise and, benefitting from the scientific experience and international contacts of the staff, they can explore methods of pedagogy, the technical measurement of performance, and the promotion of sports and movement. During the year, small groups of students will learn specific motor disciplines and sports. The second year of the degree course will be supplemented by a placement where the fundamental aspects of specific motor and sports disciplines of different ages and types will be taught. In the third year, students will learn about the theory and practical aspects of training and about how to measure the function and nutrition of athletes, individuals in training or those who practise motor activity and sport in their free time; the quality of the environment and the safety of sports equipment; orthopaedics and traumatology of sport and rules governing the running and workings of sports organisations. Students will have the opportunity to complete their studies through the technical and didactical activity with specific motor and sports disciplines for small groups. Placements teach the fundamental aspects of specific motor and sports disciplines of different-aged subjects, and types, or those with disabilities and how these subjects should be trained. A two-year English course is aimed to improve students ability; the course is necessary in that it provides students with the tools to exploit the technical and scientific knowledge available globally and to work alongside the ever-greater number of foreign athletes. Sports science students will also have to take information technology modules on a par with the ECDL. Students will be able to select ‘free activity’ courses from those available at university. The motor and sports subjects will be taken as placements and practical activities and will be awarded no less than 25 points, with a single credit-frontal lesson correspondence of between 12 and 24 hours. The course totals 180 ECTS, except in cases where students have opted to acquire extra credits.
Career opportunities
The course modules and practical activities mean that graduates tend to find employment in:
1) teaching (physical education in all types of school) 
2) in training fields (instructors, sport-specific instruction, in the preventative exercise field and the promotion of healthy living, as trainers and instructors for adults, the elderly and disabled);
3) in social services (working in physical education at social-educational organisations); 
4) in sports centres and gyms; 
5) in organising and running sports centres and gyms;
6) in ensuring the safety of sports centres and similar establishments; 
7) in rehabilitation centres; 
8) in health and social-health organisations and in care homes.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, the student must possess the upper secondary school diploma required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires adequate initial preparation in mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, as well as knowledge of current affairs and general and sporting culture and logical reasoning skills. The student who enters the Degree Course is expected to have positive motivation and aptitude for physical and sporting activities. The methods for verifying the adequacy of the initial preparation and the recovery of any gaps and educational deficits of the student (to be filled in any case within the first year of studies) are governed by the teaching regulations of the degree course. With reference to knowledge of the Italian language, students of foreign nationality are required, for the purposes of accessing the degree course, to have Level B of the European Reference Framework for Modern Languages of the Council of Europe.
