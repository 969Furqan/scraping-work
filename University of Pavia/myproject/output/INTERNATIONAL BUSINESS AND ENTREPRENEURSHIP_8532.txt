Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The Master's Degree Course in 'International Business and Entrepreneurship' (MIBE) aims to train professional figures equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to best manage the internationalization and innovation processes in companies, including the challenges of digital transformation. Particular attention is also given to the development of a modern entrepreneurial culture, crucial in the contemporary economy both for small businesses and for managers of large multinationals. MIBE therefore offers a solid interdisciplinary preparation, mainly including managerial teachings, but also guaranteeing economic, legal and quantitative foundations. Significant attention is also assigned to the valorisation of digital technologies in a strategic-organisational key. Furthermore, in order to attract prepared and motivated foreign students, further developing the internationalization objective of the Department, which already makes use of mobility and double degree programs with various renowned European universities, the degree course is held entirely in English, examining in particular the international aspects of economic and business disciplines. Furthermore, each proposed disciplinary line corresponds to consolidated research traditions developed within the Department. The training objective of the course is to provide students with the tools to operate in institutional contexts (public and private, profit and non-profit) characterized by a high level of internationalisation. MIBE provides a core of fundamental managerial, economic and legal teachings aimed at equipping students with the analysis tools that constitute the fundamental basis for understanding the evolution of the international economic scenario, with a slant oriented towards innovation and soft skills ( leadership, problem solving, public speaking, team working, etc.), as meta-skills to face and prepare for the challenges of a constantly evolving job market. Furthermore, specialized courses are planned. In general, the basic courses are accompanied by a series of courses aimed at analyzing microeconomic and macroeconomic issues relating to the international context (international economics, analysis of emerging markets) and industrial economics, also with reference to contexts characterized by a high degree of innovation technological. Particular attention is also assigned to subjects related to digital technologies. The possibility of carrying out a training internship at qualified companies is also promoted. The training process ends with the development and discussion of an original degree dissertation, created under the supervision of a supervisor designated by the Department, through which the student's analytical skills, his ability to express himself in the English language and the ability to tackle complex problems using the theoretical, quantitative and operational tools offered by the degree course. The thesis may also have as its object the development, in a multinational company or an international institution, of a specific project previously agreed between the supervisor designated by the Department and a manager at the host structure.
