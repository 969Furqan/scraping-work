Educational goals
The Degree Course in Administration and Governance aims to train various professional or managerial figures who have as a common denominator skills in the field of economic and financial analysis of business processes and functions; planning, control and detection of internal and external phenomena of company management, for the purpose of preparing external (financial statements) or internal (budgets and programs) financial reports and fiscal/tax returns; understanding of the company's governance mechanisms with reference to the various legislative, regulatory and statutory contexts.
Although these figures may refer to distinct roles that involve the performance of employment or free-lance activities, including consultancy, all the figures that the course intends to train are characterized by knowledge related to economics, business administration and law; application and technical communication skills, aimed as a whole at the administration of economic organizations and legal knowledge in the areas of direct interest of companies and entities (private and public).
Specifically, the degree course is aimed at those who wish to operate – at staff, middle management or manager/executive level – in the administration of companies; to those who wish to qualify as Statutory Auditors or to undertake a career in Independent Auditors and to those who wish to become Accounting Experts (section B of the Single Register of Chartered Accountants and Accounting Experts).
Overall, therefore, the training objective is declined with reference to the following areas:

• Economics: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the basic elements for understanding the functioning of the macroeconomic system and the ability to interpret and analyze the economic context and the rules that guide the choices of consumers and firms, through the analytical paradigm and the appropriate methodological tools in addition to the standard topics of modern industrial economics,  with particular reference to oligopolistic market models and social welfare analysis;
• Statistical-mathematical area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire basic skills in the mathematical field both from a theoretical point of view and in view of future applications in the economic-business field, the basic analytical tools for the formalization, evaluation and management of economic-financial problems, the fundamental tools of statistics useful for understanding and solving economic and business problems and typical of the social sciences;
• legal area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the necessary tools to understand the function of legal rules in the production and circulation of wealth and to offer the necessary knowledge to make decisions in the economic context with full awareness of their legal implications; provides an organic framework of company law and the skills necessary to understand the legal problems related to the establishment, financing, organization and management of a company and to frame them according to Italian law; students will acquire the knowledge needed to grasp the multiple reciprocal interactions that characterize regulatory processes and economic decisions, both at an institutional and functional level.
The training course is divided into six semesters in which in-depth knowledge of business economics disciplines is provided with particular reference to issues related to the administration and governance of the company, knowledge in relation to basic economic-political disciplines, basic and applied mathematical-statistical tools, legal principles and institutions with particular reference to private, commercial and tax legislation,  as well as knowledge of English at an intermediate level and computer skills for the purpose of analyzing qualitative and quantitative data. In order to ensure a solid multidisciplinary theoretical and methodological background, the first three semesters are characterized by courses related to business economics and business management, macro and microeconomics, private and corporate law and mathematical and statistical tools. These courses are for the most part also common to the other three-year degree courses offered by the Department. In the fourth, fifth and sixth semesters, courses are specifically aimed at developing knowledge of the main forms of financial reporting, company valuation and planning and control processes; the operating logic of the banking company; the fundamentals of corporate finance; the legal systems in the field of taxation and constitutionality.
