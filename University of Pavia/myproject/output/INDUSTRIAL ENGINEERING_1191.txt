The Bachelor’s Degree Program in Industrial Engineering offers a broad, technically-oriented education based on core engineering disciplines, with a particular focus on the industrial and research sectors. The program is structured into three main curricula: Energy, Mechanical Engineering, and Management.
These tracks cover a wide range of fields including energy production, manufacturing industry, transportation, factory automation, industrial production, the automotive sector, energy efficiency, industrial planning, logistics, and industrial management.
These are essential areas for both large and small-to-medium-sized enterprises, as well as for advanced services (plant management, consulting, transportation, large-scale facilities), where there has long been a consistent demand for specialized skills and qualified technical personnel in the labor market.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The Degree Course in Industrial Engineering will train engineers able to carry out the activities required in the industrial sector:
- Inside factories and manufactories
- in companies whose main purpose or a significant part is industrial activities, such as energy management, mechanical production and transport companies
- design studies of industrial and civil plants
- technical or managerial sections of the public administration
- freelance activities related to the industrial sector
To this end, the course offers a wide-ranging engineering training including knowledge of the scientific bases, problems and basic operational techniques of industrial engineering in the electrical, mechanical and energy fields, also including skills in design, operation and maintenance, and in general in the management of industrial activities, also in the light of the general legislation on safety at work.
The basic notions in the disciplines of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science are followed by a core of courses common to the various engineering sectors that include electrical engineering, technical physics, applied mechanics, the fundamentals of automatic control and industrial measurements and the principles of economics. Just over half of the credits are dedicated to the related courses.
The training is therefore completed with numerous courses and operational skills that can be organized according to different areas, among which are highlighted: electricity and energy (oriented to the knowledge of energy sources in the transition to renewables, and their distribution and use in the industrial and civil sectors); the mechanical one (aimed at deepening the aspects of modeling and mechanical technology and their application in the perspective of digital transition), and that of management (in which industrial skills converge in organization, logistics and relations with the market and in all the technical-economic processes of companies).
The type of course is mainly methodological, but a company experience with the tool of the training internship is also encouraged, through specific courses specially prepared and followed by tutors and university professors.
The degree course allows you to have as an outlet both the work activity and the continuation of training with the enrollment in a master's degree or other specialization courses, especially in the same industrial field.
Career opportunities
Junior Industrial Engineer
Skills in the digital transition of industry and the economy are in high demand by the market. And the demand for professionals able to work with new technologies is significant. Career opportunities can therefore concern: 
• Multinational or large companies operating in the industrial sector 
• Small and medium-sized companies engaged in the mechanical, electrical, plant engineering industry 
• Energy production bodies and companies 
• Bodies and companies for sustainable transport and electric mobility 
• Construction companies 
• Public technical structures (Public interest bodies such as State Railways,  Post and Telecommunications, Public Works) 
• Companies supplying systems, services and components for industrial engineering 
• Professional firms operating in the field of industrial and civil engineering and plant engineering 
• Graduates who have sufficient credits in appropriate groups of sectors may, as required by current legislation, participate in the admission tests for training courses for secondary education.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, students must have an upper secondary school diploma required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. As far as the initial preparation is concerned, some specific knowledge of Mathematics and the ability to use the English language adequately are considered essential; a good basic knowledge of Physics and Chemistry is also considered important. The Faculty offers students who intend to enrol a test (admission test), the outcome of which certifies the student's overall degree of competence in the aforementioned areas. For Mathematics and English only, any debt of knowledge of the student is deducted from the same test, which can be compensated after enrolment. The requirements for Mathematics and English Language and the methods for making up for any gaps and deficits in training are defined in the teaching regulations.
