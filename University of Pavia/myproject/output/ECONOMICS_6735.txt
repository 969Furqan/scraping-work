Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The course of study in Economics aims to provide an education that allows graduates to understand the economic mechanisms that govern markets, behaviors and economic choices of individuals, companies and institutions. Graduates will have the tools to analyze and understand macroeconomic dynamics, changes in the economic and social environment and the causes and effects of economic policies, with the aim of entering the careers of economic analysts, strategic consulting and management consulting for private companies and public bodies. The course also aims to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills necessary to continue their studies in second-level university courses.
To this end, the training course integrates a basic core with a specific training course. In the core of the course, courses are offered in the areas of business, economics, statistics, mathematics and law. The core provides the quantitative tools and basic notions to be able to interact with all economic and institutional actors, in the business, legal and economic fields. The core is integrated with a specific training course that deepens the core and focuses in particular on courses in the mathematical-statistical and economic areas. The aim of the specific training is to provide graduates with the theoretical tools to understand the behavior of individuals and firms, the organization of markets and industrial sectors, and the aggregate functioning of the economic system. More generally, graduates know the methods of economic investigation and acquire the ability to abstract complex phenomena that are useful in determining policy and business strategies. In addition, the training course provides graduates with the statistical and econometric tools that allow data analysis to support decisions.
The learning areas included in the course of study are functional to the achievement of the learning objectives, specifically:
- Business Area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the basic principles of business economics, the fundamentals of business management and the operational logic of companies. The business area courses provide the basic knowledge to understand the functioning of companies and to interact with the professional figures operating in the entrepreneurial field.
- Legal area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the fundamentals of private law, commercial law and economic law to understand the legislative context and rules in which markets operate and in which companies and public and private institutions operate.
- Statistical-mathematical area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the quantitative tools necessary for economic and financial analysis and data analysis. You are also provided with the ability to apply them in the areas of mathematics for economics and finance, statistics and econometrics.
- Economics area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the fundamental notions of economic analysis and methods of economic investigation. In particular, these courses will provide the theoretical basis for understanding the behavior of individuals and firms, the functioning of markets and production systems, aggregate economic dynamics, economic policies, and the theoretical and applied econometric tools necessary for empirical analysis.
- Linguistics and computer science areas: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the skills necessary to understand and communicate in English and the fundamentals of computer science.
The training course is divided into six semesters. In the first three semesters, in order to ensure a solid multidisciplinary basic and methodological preparation, courses are taught, largely common to the other three-year degree courses offered by the Department, including disciplines of economics, business, law and statistics/mathematics; In addition to these, there is the teaching of the English language (at an intermediate level), as well as the learning of appropriate computer skills. This solid preliminary base of teaching activities is completed, starting from the fourth semester, by an articulated range of courses appropriately selected in order to orient the training towards more specific objectives, in order to provide students with both theoretical and empirical tools capable of allowing them to interpret the observed economic trends, formulate forecasts on future dynamics and critically examine possible behavioral strategies for companies, operators and institutions.
The training course is completed with the learning of quantitative techniques, especially of an econometric nature, as well as the performance of further appropriate related and integrative activities. The training course ends with an internship aimed at facilitating entry into the world of work.
