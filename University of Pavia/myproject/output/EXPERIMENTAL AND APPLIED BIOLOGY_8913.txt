The Master's Degree in Experimental and Applied Biology will provide cultural and experimental training in various fields of applied biology and knowledge of instrumental methodology, analytical tools, and techniques for acquiring and analyzing biological data, enabling the biologist to engage in basic or applied research activities. During the two-year program, the student attends a research laboratory, participating in experimental activities that will lead to the development of their thesis at the end of their studies.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The Master's Degree Course in "Experimental and Applied Biology" aims to provide a solid and integrated culture in all areas of applied biology by combining cutting-edge theoretical preparation with intense laboratory activity and providing for the training of graduates who must possess, depending on the chosen curriculum, a solid scientific and operational preparation in the environmental sectors,  analytical and biomedical. The course of study aims to provide students with:- knowledge of advanced methodologies;- knowledge of data acquisition and analysis techniques in the various fields of biology;- critical analysis skills required of a biologist who must carry out professional and managerial activities in the various fields of application. On the basis of the chosen curriculum, students will also acquire:
- knowledge related to the biodiversity of ecosystems, using a dynamic-evolutionary approach, integrated with specialized knowledge dedicated to modern molecular techniques applied to the study of the environment and to the statistical analysis of biological data;- theoretical-practical knowledge necessary for carrying out biochemical, genetic, microbiological, cytological, parasitological and toxicological analyses,  accompanied by knowledge of the problems related to regulations in the laboratory, health and environmental fields and integrated by a solid in-depth study of the application aspects of molecular and cellular disciplines, such as biochemistry, genetics, microbiology;- knowledge in the biomedical field, with particular reference to physio-pathological processes at molecular, cellular and systemic level and pharmacological tools for preventive and therapeutic purposes,  knowledge in the biomedical field applied to research, diagnostics and therapy in the genetic and genetic-molecular fields. During their course, students will deepen and improve their knowledge of the English language, also with reference to disciplinary lexicons, through the assignment, as an object of monographic reading, of original research articles to be presented and discussed under the supervision of the reference professors. In order to achieve the objectives and knowledge indicated above, the training course includes:- in the first year, training activities aimed at deepening the knowledge of basic biology and its applications, with specific characterizing courses diversified according to the curriculum; For example, courses are provided in the microbiological/mycological, biochemical/clinical, statistical, genetic/molecular, parasitological fields with the aim of training an analytical biologist; teachings in the ecological and environmental fields, with in-depth studies in the field of biodiversity and bioconservation, with the aim of training an environmental biologist; courses in the field of basic cellular and molecular disciplines, with in-depth studies in the pathological and therapeutic fields, with the aim of training a biologist with an advanced and operational preparation in the field of biomedical-molecular sciences;- in the second year, training activities aimed at completing the basic preparation of the student in the analytical, bioenvironmental and biomedical-molecular fields;- for all curricula there is also a compulsory thesis internship,  to be carried out at universities, companies, public administration structures, highly qualified laboratories, whose duration can vary from one to two years and whose objective is to provide the student with the "problem solving" skills necessary for those who will work in any field of biology. The training course ends with a final exam that consists of the production, presentation and discussion of an original paper in which the results of scientific or technological research are reported.
Career opportunities
Biologist
The main employment opportunities that graduates can cover are:
- scientific research activities at research facilities at universities, scientific hospitals and public bodies (e.g. National Research Council and National Health Council);
- diagnostic and quality control activities at chemical-clinical and microbiological analysis laboratories;
- laboratories of chemical-pharmaceutical, biotechnological and agri-food industries;
- analysis and consulting laboratories for forensic applications;
- pharmacological companies;
- institutes for accreditation and certification according to ISO standards;
- zooprophylactic institutes;
- national and regional environmental agencies (e.g. ARPA);
- sales representatives in the areas of pharmacology, cellular and molecular biology and biomedical instrumentation;
- private activity in the field of nutrition;
- Teaching activities at various levels in the field of biology.
Admission requirements
In order to be admitted to the Master's Degree Course in "Experimental and Applied Biology", students must have a degree (including the one obtained according to the regulations in force prior to Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent offices of the University. Admission is also required to meet curricular requirements and the student's initial preparation.
The minimum curricular requirements are related to the acquisition of:
- at least 12 credits in one or more of the following SSDs in mathematics, physics, computer science: MAT/01 – MAT/09; FIS/01 – FIS/08; INF/01;
- at least 12 CFU in one or more of the following SSDs in the chemical field: CHIM/03, CHIM/06;
- at least 9 credits in one or more of the following SSDs in the botanical, zoological and ecological fields: BIO/02, BIO/03, BIO/05, BIO/07.
The methods for verifying the student's initial preparation are defined in the Didactic Regulations of the Degree Programme.
