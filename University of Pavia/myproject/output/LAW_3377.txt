The Masterâ€™s Degree program in Law is designed to train graduates with a thorough ability to analyze and connect legal norms, and to formulate written and oral arguments with an awareness of their technical-legal, cultural, practical, and value implications. The program aims to develop the skills necessary for effectively addressing general and specialized legal issues, cases, and legal phenomena.
Additionally, the program strives to enable students to use at least one European Union language other than Italian fluently, both in written and oral form, with reference to disciplinary lexicons.
This advanced legal education provides the level of legal knowledge required for entry into the legal professions.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The aim of the five-year degree course in Law is to provide advanced legal training and mastery of the cultural and methodological tools necessary for a solid grounding in general and special legal issues, cases and facts. The aim of the modules in the degree programme is to provide a sound knowledge and awareness of the techniques used for legal understanding, interpretation and reasoning. 

Furthermore, in the final two years of the course, students can choose from a number of specialist subjects, which reflect their professional aptitudes and objectives.

To this end, the five-year degree course:

	provides the basic and advanced knowledge in the disciplines belonging to the areas set out in the table attached to the ministerial decree of 25 November 2005, and provides a general consistency of education by shaping the content to the goals of the degree class;

	uses the disciplines within the related, additional and core subjects to characterise the education provided in each of the various professional areas to which the degree course provides access;

	provides consistency in the education offered through technical and methodological skills to overcome rapid obsolescence, and to ensure that the knowledge and skills acquired remain useful;

	provides, by means of modules taught by appropriate methods, a solid knowledge and awareness of: the institutional and organisational aspects of legal orders; professional ethics, logic and reasoning in legal practice; legal sociology; IT and the law; the legal language of at least one foreign language, with a view to their use in post-degree courses for the legal professions.
