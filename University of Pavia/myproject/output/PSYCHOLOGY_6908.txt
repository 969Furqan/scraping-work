Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The master's degree course is aimed at achieving specific training objectives aimed at deepening psychological knowledge and preparing professional figures who can operate autonomously in the various areas of psychological disciplines. These training objectives are achieved through advanced level training to be acquired during the two years of study through characterizing, similar/integrative training activities and the activities included in the practical-evaluative-TPV internship. The expected articulation between the characterizing theoretical training activities and the practical-evaluative ones aims to acquire the necessary tools to operate in the field of psychological evaluation and interventions in the main areas of psychological disciplines, namely: - in the field of clinical psychology by providing specific knowledge relating to the emotional and relational factors of individual development; delving into the aspects of the relational approach, the interview, the evaluation and diagnosis of personal characteristics and the risks and problems connected to the psychological dynamics of the subject. In this case, the main objective is to prepare professional figures capable of evaluating the ways in which psychological well-being functions in relation to the different phases of development and to prepare, therefore, professional figures who will be able to operate in the area of prevention and treatment of psychological distress. - in the field of developmental and educational psychology, providing in-depth preparation on the mechanisms of transformation and change required of individuals by different developmental tasks throughout the entire life cycle, to train professional figures who can work individually or in an interdisciplinary connection in the field of educational/scholastic services, health and/or educational services for children, adolescents and families, and in the field of research (basic and applied). - in the field of work and organizational psychology, providing advanced knowledge, at a theoretical and methodological level, of the disciplines taught, and the specific professional skills to operate autonomously, among other things, in the field of psychology applied to the world of organizations , work and communities, in different contexts and in different public and private, profit and non-profit institutions. In this case the main training objectives include providing specialist knowledge, tools and methodologies of analysis, research and intervention in the context of: procedures and techniques for evaluation, assessment, selection, training, analysis of the behavior of individuals and groups in public and private companies and organizations; advanced qualitative and quantitative methodologies for basic and applied research; the theoretical and epistemic foundations of psychosocial research and practice; of the psychology of thought and decision-making processes; of the psychology of processes relating to consumption and economic behavior - in the field of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, providing tools and advanced notions of cognitive psychology, aimed at understanding brain functioning, human and comparative neurophysiology, neuroimaging techniques, artificial intelligence, with attention to possible application areas, including in the evolutionary field and in normal and pathological aging. Tools and techniques for diagnosis and specific intervention will be explored in depth, in the cognitive and metacognitive field, as well as cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation techniques in the clinical field. In this case, the main objective is to train professional figures who can operate in the field of basic and applied research, in hospital and healthcare settings, and in the field of personal services. Specific attention is given to the coherence and synergy between the characterizing theoretical teachings and the training activities of a professionalizing nature, with the planning of courses of a practical-applicative nature and the connection with the experiences of the Practical Evaluation Internship carried out in the area (TPV). The internship (20 CFU) allows the achievement of the following skills: a) case evaluation; b) appropriate use of psychological tools and techniques for gathering information to carry out an analysis of the case and context; c) preparation of a theoretically grounded and evidence-based professional intervention; d) evaluation of the process and outcome of the intervention; e) drafting a report; f) return to patient/customer/user/institution/organisation; g) establish adequate relationships with patients/customers/users/institutions/organisations; h) establish adequate relationships with colleagues; i) understanding of the legal/ethical/deontological profiles of the profession, as well as their possible conflicts. l) design and implementation of experimental projects For the purposes of what is described above, the master's degree course may include a division into recommended paths.

Admission requirements
To be admitted to the master's degree course, the student must be in possession of a degree (including that obtained according to the regulations previously in force under Ministerial Decree 509/1999 and subsequent amendments and additions) or a three-year university diploma, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires the possession of curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's initial preparation. The required curricular requirements are: no less than 88 Curricular Training Credits (CFU) in at least 7 psychological Scientific Disciplinary Sectors (SSD) from M-PSI/01 to M-PSI/08 or equivalent curricular requirements in the case of a career achieved in a foreign university . The methods for evaluating the curricular requirements and the adequacy of the student's initial preparation are reported in the teaching regulations of the master's degree course. The recognition of the 10 TPV credits that can be carried out within the three-year degree may possibly be considered equivalent even in the case of activities carried out within foreign degree programmes. In the absence of recognition, total or partial, of the 10 CFU of TPV, the student will be able to acquire the aforementioned missing CFU during the two-year period, as supernumerary compared to the 120 CFU of the LM.
