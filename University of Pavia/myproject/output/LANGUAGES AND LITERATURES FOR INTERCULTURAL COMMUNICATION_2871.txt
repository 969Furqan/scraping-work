The Bachelor’s Degree in Languages and Literatures for Intercultural Communication aims to provide a multidisciplinary education in foreign languages and cultures. Students will achieve a good command of both written and spoken skills in two foreign languages and will gain a broad understanding of the cultural heritage expressed through these languages.
The program offers a range of activities to deepen language proficiency, potentially leading to professional specialization with an advanced level of competence in a third language, or a more methodological focus on literary history, linguistics, and philology. For language learning, students have access to not only classroom instruction and exercises with Language Collaborators and Experts but also to the university’s Language Center, which provides self-learning resources such as equipped language labs, a rich media library with audio, video, and CD resources, and a film archive with original language films.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
he course in "Languages and Literatures for Intercultural Communication" aims to promote the acquisition of full linguistic, pragmatic and sociolinguistic competence in two European languages to achieve a level of competence in the use of the European Framework of Reference C1-C2 integrated by an advanced metalinguistic competence for each of the two languages studied (reaching 18 CFU of Language and Translation for each language). The emphasis will be on translation and intercultural communication to respond effectively to the training needs and increasingly differentiated professional expectations of future graduates in the field of inter-understanding and communication between users of different languages and cultures in varied social and work contexts and through oral and written transmission modes of media and the web. During the course of study, students will be able to develop advanced knowledge in the fields of interlingual and multimedia translation, writing and revision of texts, specialized languages and intercultural communication. The course also aims to promote the acquisition of in-depth knowledge in the field of literatures related to the languages studied, both through the in-depth study of the history of literature, and thanks to increasingly refined analyses and interpretations of representative texts belonging to genres and authors from different eras in order to refine the ability of autonomous critical reading. Competence in the literary field will also contribute to enhancing language acquisition by fostering the development of high registers in written and oral comprehension and communication and providing the interpretative tools necessary for the intercultural communication of future graduates. To further refine their linguistic and language teaching skills, also in support of the new teacher training course, students will be able to choose from a range of courses in the field of sociolinguistics and pragmatics applied to multilingual contexts, learning and teaching of foreign languages. The student will be able to enrich his/her knowledge in the field of philology and further teaching of foreign literatures of the languages studied, as well as in the fields of digital humanities and languages for digital public communication, literary publishing and journalism. In addition to the expansion of the educational offer, the student will be able to benefit from the flexibility of the study plan by building a path more oriented to literary-philological, or linguistic-translational, or even applied glottodidactic aspects. The student will therefore be able to compose, on the basis of his/her own interests and professional goals, a study plan that guarantees a solid linguistic-cultural preparation but at the same time can be oriented towards diversified educational and professional objectives.
Career opportunities
The opportunities provided by the Master's Degree Course, with functions of high responsibility, are in:
