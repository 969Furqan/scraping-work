Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The degree course in Political Science and International Relations aims to provide useful preparation both for job placement in different functional areas within different sectors of economic activity, public or private, and for the continuation of higher studies in Italy and for abroad. To this end, the course of study offers training activities aimed at transmitting basic knowledge in six different disciplinary fields: legal, economic, political, sociological, statistical and historical. The course also offers foreign language teaching aimed at consolidating the linguistic skills already acquired in secondary education courses, as well as introducing knowledge of specialized lexicons and other foreign languages, including those outside Europe. The course of studies is structured in two parts. One is dedicated to training activities common to all students; at least 66 training credits are attributed to them among the basic and characterizing disciplines present in particular in the first year. At least 12 credits are added to the list of common activities included in the further training activities (further linguistic knowledge, training internships, IT skills, useful knowledge for entering the world of work). The other part characterizes and differentiates the study path and is dedicated to the in-depth study of specific areas of study. The structure of the training course allows us to provide multidisciplinary preparation, useful for understanding: i) the complex dynamics of political-social, economic, historical and legal phenomena in a European and international perspective; ii) the governance dynamics that characterize the public administration system in their interactions with public and private operators and with European institutions.
Career opportunities
From the analysis of the labor market, based on surveys relating to the employment status of graduates and on the consultation of organizations representing production, services and professions, it emerges that the employment and professional opportunities are the most varied thanks to the multidisciplinary training received by the students. Furthermore, the possibility of differentiating and characterizing the training path allows students to be directed towards specific areas of employment, stimulate their curiosity, enhance their talents and therefore provide suitable profiles both for continuing their studies and for carrying out a profession. The employment of graduates concerns the private and public sector, although in more recent years there has been a greater absorption capacity on the part of the private sector. Precisely the multidisciplinary approach guarantees a high level of adaptability to the variety of professional figures required by the job market.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, the student must possess the upper secondary school diploma required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. For admission, knowledge of the English language corresponding to the A2 level of the European reference framework is also required as adequate initial preparation. The methods for verifying the adequacy of the initial preparation and the recovery of any gaps and educational deficits of the student (to be filled in any case within the first year of studies) are governed by the teaching regulations of the degree course.
