Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The Master's Degree in Musicology aims at a broad and differentiated education. Master's degree graduates will have acquired the appropriate skills for the management and conservation of musical heritage (books, organological, phonographic). They will also have acquired a solid knowledge of musical repertoires, which will allow them to manage the production and promotion of musical events within public or private structures interested in the dissemination of musical culture, including training institutes. Master's degree graduates will also have developed the palaeographic and philological skills to work in the field of music publishing as curators or music consultants. Finally, master's degree graduates will have the skills to offer original scientific and interdisciplinary research in the field of historical musicology, as well as systematic musicology and ethnomusicology.
The wide range of musicological and extramusicological disciplines that characterize the educational path of the master's degree graduate guarantees the acquisition of in-depth knowledge in the various declinations of historical musicology (history of music, musical philology, bibliography and archival documentation, organology, performance practice) and systematic (musical analysis, musical sociology, musical aesthetics), as well as in the fields of ethnomusicology and popular music. Linguistic, historical, philosophical and scientific disciplines applied to the various fields of musical knowledge also contribute to a greater interdisciplinary understanding of musical phenomena. Finally, the training of the master's degree graduate is completed with the knowledge of the main computer tools applied to musicological research and the ability to express themselves in written and oral form in at least one language of the European Union in addition to Italian.
The course of study is structured in such a way as to be able to provide several in-depth courses that focus from time to time on one of the various areas of operation of the musicologist, in view of his or her inclusion in the world of work as a consultant for production institutions, editorial manager, curator and conservator of musical heritage and as a promoter of cultural events.
