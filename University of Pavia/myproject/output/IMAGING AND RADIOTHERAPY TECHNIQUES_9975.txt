Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The main objective of the course is the training of a graduate professional with specific skills and knowledge in the field of radiology techniques. These skills are achieved through a theoretical-practical path that allows the student to acquire responsibility for the acts of his competence up to the point of carrying out radiological investigations and services in compliance with the radiation protection standards provided for by the European Union. The Medical Radiology Technician must be able to carry out, independently, or in collaboration with other healthcare professionals, on medical prescription all interventions that require the use of ionizing radiation sources, both artificial and natural, thermal, ultrasonic energy, nuclear magnetic resonance as well as interventions for physical or dosimetric protection. Must be able to participate in the planning and organization of work within the structure; They must know the ethical and legal limits of the profession and demonstrate that they possess negotiation and conciliation skills by working as a member of a team. The training has been developed in such a way as to cover the three levels of know-how, know-how and know-how. After a preparation on the basic subjects, the student tackles the characterizing subjects with lectures or interactive. Finally, the student actively experiments with the ward tutor all the radiological projections until he reaches complete professional autonomy during the internship.

Biomedical Sciences Area
At the end of the course of study, the student must know the human anatomy necessary for the correct realization of radiological projections and the correct positioning of the patient for CT and MRI examinations. To know human physiology with particular reference to what is necessary to understand the effects of ionizing radiation and magnetic fields on the human body as well as the implications of the pharmacodynamics of contrast agents.

Preparatory Sciences Area
At the end of the course of study, the student must know the physical principles and the construction bases of modern X-ray, MRI and CT devices in order to understand the implications on their daily use and the principles of safe use and for radiation protection.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques Area
At the end of the course of study, the student must be able to guarantee the use of appropriate methods and technologies for the correct performance of diagnostic and therapeutic examinations in the main areas of work of the TSRM (radiology, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy) ensuring the necessary radiation protection and safety measures.

Hygienic-Preventive and Radio-Protection Area
At the end of the course of study, the student must know the determinants of health, hazards and risk factors and apply prevention strategies, individual and collective protective equipment and interventions aimed at protecting the health and safety, both of workers and users, in the workplace.
Career opportunities
The TSRM operates, as an employee or freelancer, in any field, which involves the use of ionizing radiation sources, both artificial and natural, thermal energy, ultrasonic energy, nuclear magnetic resonance as well as interventions for physical or dosimetric protection, i.e. in hospital and non-hospital facilities of the National Health System and in similar private structures; in scientific institutes of hospitalization and care, both under public and private law; in manufacturing industries and sales agencies operating in the field of diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy; in university and non-university research centres in the biomedical and veterinary sectors. In healthcare, where he carries out his activity in the area of diagnosis, therapy, interventional and prevention. In nuclear medicine, the TSRM also prepares, for each patient, the dose of radiopharmaceutical to be injected for the performance of scintigraphy or positron emission tomography (PET and CT-PET), taking care of the activities related to the chemical laboratory called "hot room". In radiation therapy, the TSRM conducts the procedures for radiation therapy, preparing the patient for radiation therapy, explaining the procedure, and positioning them appropriately. It also prepares for each patient, personalized devices necessary for proper treatment (screens, masks, etc.).
In interventional radiology, the TSRM, in close collaboration with the radiologist, performs all invasive or minimally invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures carried out through the guidance and control of methods such as fluoroscopy and CT.
In complementary radiology (hemodynamics, electrophysiology, operating rooms, etc.) it provides the surgeon with radioscopic or radiographic images, having the specific competence of controlling the applications of the technical procedures, agreed with the radiologist in charge of the equipment, in particular on the exposures of patients during the execution of radiological examinations carried out by the specialist who uses ionizing radiation in a complementary way according to the specifications of law
In health physics, the TSRM collaborates with medical physicists and service managers to solve problems in the use of radiation sources for diagnostics, therapy and research and for the protection of the patient from ionizing radiation, implementing all the necessary and appropriate strategies to limit the absorbed dose; In particular, he checks the correct functioning of the equipment entrusted to him.
The Degree in Medical Radiology, Imaging and Radiotherapy Techniques gives access to the first-level Master's courses, to the Master's Degree.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, the student must be in possession of an upper secondary school diploma, required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad deemed suitable.
Admission to the degree course is limited to the planning of admissions at national level (Law no. 264 of 2 August 1999).
Admission takes place through a competitive examination; the date and methods of carrying out this test are defined annually by the Ministry of University and Research and published in a special announcement issued by the University. The number of places is fixed annually by decree of the Ministry of University and Research.
Students admitted to the Degree Course with a grade lower than a pre-established minimum threshold may be assigned specific additional educational obligations; the methods for making up for any educational deficits, to be filled in any case within the first year of the course, are governed by the Didactic Regulations of the Degree Course.
