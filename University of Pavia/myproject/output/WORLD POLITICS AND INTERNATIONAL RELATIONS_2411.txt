The two-year Master in World politics and international relations is taught entirely in English and aims to provide a broad, multidisciplinary training in comparative and international studies, in particular in the areas of politics, history, law and economics. The courses in comparative studies aim to improve the student’s ability to interpret and analyse the different political systems of the world as outcomes of path dependent economic and political structures and developments. The courses in international studies aim to deepen the student’s understanding of how the interactions among political systems have unfolded in the most important geopolitical settings, and of how they influence contemporary trends in challenging and answering the basic goals of political systems and human security. Most of the teaching is interactive, involving student participation, presentations and discussions, and essay writing. Some courses also involve the participation of outside speakers and practitioners. In the second year, students have the chance to gain some work experience and professional training, and many visit non-Italian universities on exchange programs. The degree course attracts applicants from all around the world: in recent years, nearly a half of the enrolled students have been non-Italian.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The second-level degree course in World Politics and International Relations aims to prepare graduates who are able to recognise and analyse the forms that the organisation of political systems can take in different national contexts, and how such forms are shaped by the relations between political systems.    
In accordance with the learning goals of the degree class, the course has a multidisciplinary approach which combines modules on politics (which have the most ECTS) with modules on history, economics, statistics, law and sociology.  
As a result of the advanced interdisciplinary approach of the programme, students will be able to identify the fundamental structures and patterns of the political units – mainly nation states - found on the world scene. Students will be able to compare the internal features using relevant socio-demographic methodologies and determine how they mutually affect the international relations systems in which they are located.  
The learning goal of the degree course in World Politics and International Relations is to study individual political systems (or categories of systems) in a highly inter-related world context which requires them to adapt. 
Classes are taught in such a way as to encourage interdisciplinary theorizing, thus contributing to the training of experts able to interpret political, social, legal, economic and historical reality in all its complexity. Thus, the different disciplines (political science, sociology, law, economics, history) do not represent separate and distinct study areas, but interrelated aspects of a single object of study. The area in which the course trains its graduates is general from the disciplinary point of view, but unitary and advanced in terms of the topics treated.
Career opportunities
The role of graduates in employment:
The degree course in World Politics and International Relations prepares students to enter careers as mid-ranking to senior political consultants both in government and legislative bodies and in national and supranational political and economic organisations.
The course aims to prepare specialists in world political systems who are thoroughly aware of the inter-relations between such systems, who will be able to enter careers as mid-ranking to senior professionals or consultants in public or private organisations, particularly in associations, institutions and organisations with strategic decision-making functions as regards international policies and relations.
Skills associated with the role: 
Graduates in World Politics and International Relations possesses special knowledge, both factual and theoretical, of the different political systems of the world, the relationship between domestic and foreign policy, international law and regional law, and the history of political systems and international relations. They can use this knowledge critically, to formulate arguments and to develop useful strategies for public and private organizations in the international arena. They may also possess specific expertise in election monitoring, in the enforcement of human rights and in international diplomacy, as well as more specific skills acquired through training. 
Career opportunities: 
The degree prepares professionals able to operating at high levels of responsibility in government organizations at the national or international level, in other private and public organizations, in multinational companies, research institutions, and in communication, journalism and publishing. In addition, the course represents a starting point for research at the doctoral level.
