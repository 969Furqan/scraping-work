The ability to produce and manage communicative content conveyed through digital media has become an essential requirement for all private and public organizations. However, it is not easy to integrate the variety of expertise involved in this type of communication process. The Master's Degree in Digital Communication addresses these needs by training the professional figure of the Digital Communication Manager. This is a professional specialized in coordinating heterogeneous professional groups that encompass all the skills required for the design, implementation, and management of digital communication products. To perform this role, it is necessary to have a truly multidisciplinary education that integrates languages and models from the ICT world with those of digital legislation and jurisprudence, dedicated editorial content creation, market analysis, and the use of Big Data.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The main objective of the Master's degree in Digital Communication is to train students in adequate scientific knowledge, critical awareness and technical-specialist skills for the analysis, management and evaluation of all communication phenomena that use direct and indirect digital tools.
The suggested master’s degree course is designed to train:
a) specific skills in analysing operational problems related to the world of communication with particular reference to the implementation of digital technologies;
b) specific skills for the creation of digital communication products, communication campaigns on digital media, tools for the management of the communication with stakeholders; 
c) specific knowledge in the evaluation of operational solutions.
These objectives are developed from a highly multi-disciplinary perspective that, in addition to analysis and design skills, enables the development of the critical awareness necessary to discuss and evaluate the ethical consequences and social repercussions  communicated through digital media.
Furthermore, the Master’s degree objective is to develop the interpersonal and management skills required to coordinate the work of a team of specialists.
The study plan (120 ECTS) is organised into five areas, which content was created according to the objectives described above.
The five areas are as follow:
a. Engineering area for which course content is planned on:
i. digital technologies hardware and software infra-structure and protection models of cybersecurity;
ii.integrated digital ecosystems
iii. web and social media platform optimisation technologies (SEO and SEM)
b. Methodological area in which students will develop specific knowledge in managing digital tools typical of social and political, economic and market research such as:
i.Data construction models through digital platforms (CAWI systems;CATI; BIGDATA dataware-housing);
ii.complex data analysis models using specific algorithms (BIG DATA
analytics and simulation scenes based on machine learning);
iii.models for analysis of political and institutional marketing processes for the support of public decision;
c. Content production area with the following courses:
i.linguistics of digital communication;
ii.analysis and management of digital communication for public opinion;
iii.digital marketing with a focus on the private and public sector;
iv.narrative communication tools applied to the digital world;
v.models of digital journalism.
d. Juridical area that will allow the development of specific skills in legislation in the areas of:
i.protection of personal data
ii. Intellectual property and digital communication 
iii.public law 
iv. communication and information in public administration 
e. Area of digital processes in organisations in which will be developed skills of :
i.public relations
ii.digital organisational models and human resources
iii.public diplomacy and the digital era.
The lectures will be structured in a step-by-step model. For all the learning areas indicated, an initial course of a more institutional nature is proposed, providing the specialist theoretical framework of the area, followed by courses that allow for more in-depth specialisation.
Some courses are offered alternatively to allow personalised student learning around different thematic topics.
Each of these topics can be analyzed in depth at different levels, allowing students to create a possible individual study plan according to their personal educational objectives, interests and aptitudes (guided by a specific committee of the Didactic Board), respecting the multidisciplinarity to which all students are exposed.
Lectures and other teaching activities in the study plan are organised in four semesters, two years considering an incremental logic: first technical and methodological-analytical lectures are provided, then lectures that provide management skills.
In the final part, there is a compulsory internship experience and the completion of a dissertation evaluated through a final examination.
These last elements of the Master’s degree are aimed at allowing the student to practice the skills learnt in the first part of the course and can be designed in close connection.
