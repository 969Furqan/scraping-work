Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
In compliance with the qualifying educational objectives of the reference class, the Degree Course in Management aims at an intermediate level training for a variety of corporate or consulting roles, covering multiple functional areas.
Considering a rapidly evolving context, the training objective includes: 1) to provide knowledge and skills on the fundamental mechanisms of operation of public and, above all, private companies, acquiring adequate knowledge on the complex of administration processes and, in particular, of business management and the main tools that can be used therein; 2) provide knowledge and skills on the changes taking place in companies (small, medium and large) and in the national and international economic system in order to support and influence, also proactively, these changes towards management and competitive improvements.
The educational objective is then twofold: to provide in the first three semesters a solid core of knowledge and skills in the business, legal, statistical-mathematical and economic areas, deepened in the following three semesters by further more specific knowledge and skills characterizing the administrative and above all managerial aspect declined in the main "functional" areas of the company, without prejudice to the ability to interact with multiple economic and institutional actors.
To support internal and external interaction skills, more and more courses integrate the development of transversal skills into the specific training objectives, in particular soft skills such as the ability to communicate and present in public, the ability to work in a team and problem solving.
Overall, therefore, the training objective of the above-mentioned areas is expressed as follows:
• Business Area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the fundamentals of management and entrepreneurship, the knowledge of the operating logic of consumer and production companies, profit and non-profit, the main levers of control of corporate performance, the basic knowledge of accounting surveys and the main theoretical and operational tools for the correct drafting and reading of the financial statements,  the principles and tools of corporate investment and financing decisions (and of financial policies and operational financial management), functional and marketing knowledge for the management of companies of different nature and operating in different sectors, also with analytical tools and exercises, knowledge for analysis, organizational design, innovation of organizational processes and for the organization of information systems;
• Economics: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the basic elements for understanding the functioning of the macroeconomic system and the ability to interpret and analyze the economic context and the rules that guide the choices of consumers and firms, through the analytical paradigm and the appropriate methodological tools in addition to the standard topics of modern industrial economics,  with particular reference to oligopolistic market models and social welfare analysis;
• Statistical-mathematical area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire basic skills in the mathematical field both from a theoretical point of view and in view of future applications in the economic-business field, the basic analytical tools for the formalization, evaluation and management of economic-financial problems, the fundamental tools of statistics useful for understanding and solving economic and business problems and typical of the social sciences;
• legal area: the courses related to this area will allow students to acquire the necessary tools to understand the function of legal rules in the production and circulation of wealth and to offer the necessary knowledge to make decisions in the economic context with full awareness of their legal implications; provides an organic framework of company law and the skills necessary to understand the legal problems related to the establishment, financing, organization and management of a company and to frame them according to Italian law; students will acquire the knowledge needed to grasp the multiple reciprocal interactions that characterize regulatory processes and economic decisions, both at an institutional and functional level.
The training framework is completed by the teaching of the English language (at an intermediate level), the learning of basic computer skills and appropriate related and supplementary activities. At the end of the studies, there is an internship as well as a final exam aimed at verifying the achievement of the educational objectives of the degree course.
The Degree Course in Management also aims to allow access to all the second-level courses activated at the Department of Business Economics, even if the natural continuation is towards those of a predominantly managerial or entrepreneurial nature.
