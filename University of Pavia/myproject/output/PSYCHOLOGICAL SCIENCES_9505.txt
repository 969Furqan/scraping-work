In particular, the CdS aims to provide the theoretical and methodological foundations useful for understanding and promoting well-being at the level of individual or group behavior, as well as for understanding the impact that the different contexts and the transformations that occur during development and exert on them in the following areas: - Individual psychological functioning - Interpersonal, social and group psychological functioning - Individual neurophysiological functioning - Psychological functioning in typical and atypical contexts - Normative and psychopathological functioning - Individual and psychological functioning group of different stages of the life cycle.
