Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
Graduates in Neurophysiopathology Techniques must possess the knowledge of: 
a. the scientific bases and the specific theoretical-practical preparation in the field of neurophysiopathology techniques, a culture necessary for the practice of lifelong learning, as well as a level of professional, decision-making and operational autonomy deriving from theoretical and practical training that also includes the acquisition of behavioral skills;
b. the essential theoretical knowledge derived from the basic sciences, with a view to their subsequent professional application;
c. the ability to collaborate with the various professionals in group health activities;
d. the ability to apply, in professional decisions, also the principles of health economics;
e. the theoretical and practical aspects inherent in the diagnosis of diseases of the nervous system and the achievement of the ability to apply directly, on medical prescription, specific diagnostic methodologies in the neurological and neurosurgical field (electroencephalography, electroneuromyography, polygraphy, evoked potentials, ultrasound).
The training course of the technical professional of neurophysiopathology involves the study of preparatory disciplines and biomedical sciences in order to consolidate basic knowledge and communication skills through English language and computer skills. In this phase, the student will also acquire knowledge of the theoretical and methodological aspects on which the professional activity of the neurophysiopathology technician is based, and will carry out part of the practical activities related to the profession during the first part of the internship.
Subsequently, knowledge related to specific clinical disciplines of the course will be acquired. The theoretical aspects and practical activities of the profession will then be addressed.
To complete the student's theoretical training, the fundamental concepts of the human sciences will be acquired, as well as the knowledge of management and professional management and of the legislation of interest.
Through the internship activity, the student will acquire the skills necessary for the application of instrumental methods of neurophysiological diagnostics.
Career opportunities
Neurophysiopathology Technician
The degree in Neurophysiopathology Techniques allows you to practice the profession of neurophysiopathology technician in public and private health facilities, as an employee or freelancer.
The degree is also the basis for access to the master's degree in the sector and to the first-level master's degrees.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, students must have an upper secondary school diploma, required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad deemed suitable.
Admission to the degree course is limited by the national access planning (Law no. 264 of 2 August 1999).
Admission takes place through a competitive examination; the date and modalities of this test are defined annually by the Ministry of Education, University and Research and published in a special announcement issued by the University.
Students admitted to the degree course with a grade lower than a pre-established minimum threshold may be assigned specific additional educational obligations; the methods for making up for any educational deficits, to be filled in any case within the first year of the course, are governed by the Teaching Regulations of the degree course.
