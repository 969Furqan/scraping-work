The Bachelor's Degree Program in Musicology aims to provide foundational knowledge in various fields of musicology, including ethnomusicology and contemporary popular music, as well as areas focused on the protection, management, and enjoyment of cultural heritage, particularly musical heritage. The range of educational activities defines the cultural profile of a graduate capable of engaging in professional activities in the fields of conservation, management, promotion, production, and enhancement of musical heritage. Graduates will be prepared to work in both public (schools, libraries and documentation centers, theaters, museums, radio and television broadcasters, newspapers, concert organizing entities) and private sectors (publishing houses, record companies, artistic enterprises, software companies). The Bachelor's Degree in Musicology can serve as the initial phase of a broader educational process (master's degree programs, first-level master's programs, and similar courses).

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The course objective is to provide, through a wide-ranging teaching  and a solid methodological education, both basic knowledge in the field of historical musicology, systematic musicology and ethnomusicology, and skills in the sectors of protection, management and use of musical  assets. At the basis of the course, there are the fundamental issues of both areas.
The course aims to equip students with the skills required to work in conservation, management, promotion and the nurturing of musical heritage and who can operate successfully in public institutions (schools, libraries, archives, theatres, museums, in the media and in concert organising) and in private companies (publishers, record companies, and in arts and software houses).

The course also provides the necessary skills and knowledge for continuing studies both in the master's degree programs of the same domain and in the courses pertaining to institutions of higher artistic and musical education.
The course of 180 credits combines musicological lessons and more general humanistic studies, with the homogeneous aim of offering and developing analytical, philological and critical skills of musical phenomena together with the ability of placing and understanding them in their historical-cultural contexts of reference.
In the first two years, the course mainly deals with the basic disciplines and the musicological ones, distinguishing the historical-technical domain, and with the acquisition of linguistic and IT skills. In the second year there is a wide range of related disciplines, suitable for integrating competence, while in the third year there are the musicological distinguishing disciplines of a more specific field, together with the credits of free choice activities and the final exam.
Career opportunities
Musicologist.
Graduates in Musicology can find employment in their field of study: in public and private libraries that have a musical section or house musical sections of historical or documentary value; archive work in large musical archives; in public and private radio and television stations; in theatres; in press offices of musical institutions or event organisers; publishers and music publishers; in record companies; in the media and concert and music programming; in museums and collections of musical instruments. More generally, graduates may find employment in cataloguing, conservation, promotion and the nurturing of musical cultural patrimony.
Admission requirements
To be admitted to the degree course, the student must possess the upper secondary school diploma required by current legislation, or another qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable by the competent bodies of the University. Admission also requires, as adequate initial preparation, a general humanistic culture and basic musical knowledge acquired at Higher Music Institutes, accredited or equivalent schools or through personal study. The methods for verifying the adequacy of the initial preparation and the recovery of any gaps and educational deficits of the student (to be filled in any case within the first year of studies) are governed by the teaching regulations of the degree course.
