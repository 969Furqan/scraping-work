Artificial intelligence for science and technology
Graduates of this program will possess strongly interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in a variety of fields that characterize artificial intelligence study programs according to the best international practices. They will receive a solid and comprehensive common education in the fundamentals of certain areas of computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics, specifically focused on those that enable a deep understanding of the theoretical aspects and advanced techniques of artificial intelligence, as well as the foundations for its use in scientific, industrial, and technological innovation contexts.
Additionally, they will receive the necessary legal and social education essential to understanding the constraints that limit the socially acceptable use of these techniques. Graduates will also have the opportunity to make some choices, based on their personal goals, to enrich this common education with additional knowledge and skills useful for applying artificial intelligence in advanced ways to complex systems in specific areas, such as industrial automation, environmental monitoring, embedded systems, biomedical and health systems, complex systems modeling, and systems for physics and quantum technologies.
Graduates of this program will thus be able to contribute, based on constantly updated interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, to designing and implementing innovative solutions based on advanced artificial intelligence techniques for complex applications in both the public and private sectors. The Bachelor's degree program is delivered in English jointly with the University of Milan and the University of Milano-Bicocca.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The international master's degree program in Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology (taught in English) is specifically aimed at training graduate students specialized in advanced aspects of the theoretical foundations, techniques, methodologies, and usage of artificial intelligence in complex applications in scientific and technological fields, including industry, environment, biomedical systems, embedded systems, and complex physical systems. Graduates in Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology will be able to significantly and effectively contribute to the dissemination and advancement of knowledge and skills in this discipline and its application areas, promoting technological innovation for complex problems and systems, fostering managerial modernization in companies and public administrations, and contributing innovatively and creatively to the economic and social development of the country.

Graduates of this program will possess strongly interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in various areas characterizing artificial intelligence courses in the best international practices. They will receive a solid and in-depth common specialized training in the fundamentals of certain areas of computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics, specifically focused on those that enable a thorough understanding of the theoretical aspects and advanced techniques of artificial intelligence, as well as the fundamentals for its use in scientific, industrial, and technological innovation contexts. Additionally, they will receive necessary training in organizational-management to understand, manage, and integrate information and communication technologies into companies, as well as legal training essential to understand the constraints limiting the socially acceptable use of artificial intelligence.

Furthermore, graduates will have the opportunity to make choices, based on their personal goals, to enrich the common specialized training with additional knowledge and skills useful for applying artificial intelligence in advanced ways for complex systems in specific areas, such as industrial automation, environmental monitoring, embedded systems, biomedical systems and health, modeling of complex systems, physics, and quantum technologies.

Graduates of this program will thus be able to contribute, based on continuously updated interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, to designing and implementing innovative solutions based on advanced artificial intelligence techniques for complex applications in both the public and private sectors.

The master's degree program is structured with a succession of activities aimed at providing in-depth specialized knowledge and developing the necessary skills for entering the workforce with the ability to successfully address complex problems. The program is structured as follows:

The first year typically includes advanced educational activities dedicated to the core of specialized training in artificial intelligence, mandatory for all students, in the areas of information and communication technologies, as well as their mathematical, statistical, and physical foundations.
The first year also includes experimentation with artificial intelligence in application areas, through some recommended educational activities chosen by the student based on the selected application area offered by the degree program.
In the second year, training is completed both in the 'Business-organizational' and 'Humanities, social, legal, and economic disciplines' areas.
In the second year, it is also possible to deepen knowledge and skills in the chosen application area by selecting additional recommended educational activities, as well as freely choosing some courses based on personal cultural interests.
Typically, in the second year, students deepen their understanding of artificial intelligence, also in application areas, through theoretical-experimental internship activities for the preparation of the thesis, aimed at refining knowledge and skills in a specific theoretical or applied topic, to be carried out in a university, institution, or company, in Italy or abroad.
The educational path is completed with the final examination.
Particular attention will be given not only to conceptual aspects but also to practical experimentation in laboratory-based educational activities, especially for courses more oriented towards the study of artificial intelligence usage in application areas, in order to facilitate entry into the workforce through immediately applicable practical skills.

To ensure adequate homogenization and appropriate alignment of knowledge and skills of students coming from bachelor's degrees with diversified educational paths, even with a limited focus on information and communication technologies, activities covering specific themes will be offered to allow students to achieve, by the end of the first year, solid knowledge and skills in the areas of information and communication technologies, mathematics, and physics that are relevant for building upon the specific knowledge and skills offered by the artificial intelligence degree program. In particular, educational activities will be offered in the mathematical area to better support modeling in discrete and continuous systems, in the physical area to better support the observation, description, analysis, and modeling of elementary phenomena and systems, and in the area of information and communication technologies to better support data management, algorithm design, and the use of dedicated processing architectures and distributed processing systems.
