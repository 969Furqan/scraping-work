Choosing Visual and Performing Arts means embracing a new interdisciplinary approach to the study of theater, cinema, photography, and media, closely related to the changes and the role they have assumed in the contemporary artistic, social, and cultural landscape.
Choosing Visual and Performing Arts means developing a profile capable of integrating traditional professions linked to the studies and disciplines of cinema, performing arts, visual arts, and performing arts with new occupations emerging on the frontiers of digital culture and social dynamics, in line with a constantly growing, open, and dynamic job market.
Choosing Visual and Performing Arts means acquiring highly qualified training both in terms of theoretical and historical-critical knowledge, and in terms of design, curation, and writing within the field of visual and performative artistic, cultural, and social productions (creative writing, critical writing, screenplay writing, dramaturgy, writing for new media and digital media).

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The master's degree in Writings and Projects for the Visual and Performing Arts seeks to provide graduates with a specific competence in contemporary languages and practices in order to properly combine the ideative-artistic field with the social-participatory field. The specific objectives of the degree course are realized over two years according to specific
areas of learning.
In the first year, the aim is to develop solid knowledge and useful theoretical, historical, and critical skills to interpret the
contemporary artistic scene, adopting a strongly interdisciplinary perspective and an overall framework that takes into account
both aesthetic and artistic aspects, as well as productive and social ones. This knowledge and skills are provided through
theoretical-methodological courses and seminars in the primary and related disciplines, combining courses in the literary,
aesthetic, artistic, and anthropological fields with courses closely linked to the areas of the perfoming arts.
Career opportunities
Culture Manager (art, media, entertainment) with specific focus on the local area and public spaces
career opportunities:
The skills and knowledge acquired allow graduates access to a range of employment opportunities in the fields of media,
entertainment and cultural events. Positions range from creative and specialist positions (screenwriter; editor of texts and contributions in the field of specialised publishing; theatrical, film and television critic; drama advisor; creator of programmes and formats for film production companies and for broadcasters or television platforms; manager of the creation of integrated
communications systems; web content editor, copywriter, videomaker and visual design) to organisational jobs (curator of cultural and entertainment events, especially for public bodies, artistic director for theatrical organisations, community halls, cultural foundations and museums; social and community theatre operator, socio-educational trainer in the arts field; co-ordinator of social inclusion and territorial regeneration projects through the visual and performing arts).
