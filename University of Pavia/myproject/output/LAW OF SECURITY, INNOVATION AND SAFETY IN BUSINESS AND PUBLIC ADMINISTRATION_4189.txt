The Master's Degree in Law for Prevention, Innovation, and Security for Businesses and Public Administration (PRISMA) aims to train legal professionals capable of developing measures and strategies for preventing and managing critical issues, irregularities, or illegalities within businesses and public administrations, while also being aware of the legal implications of technological and digital innovation. The PRISMA Master's Degree program allows students to gain in-depth legal expertise on prevention topics (including privacy, administrative liability of entities, anti-corruption, prevention of business crises, tax compliance, antitrust compliance, business contracts, social security law), as well as adequate knowledge of the legal dimensions of technological innovation (artificial intelligence and public services, private law and the digital dimension, industrial law). To achieve these educational objectives, PRISMA graduates also acquire basic knowledge in economic-business and engineering-informatics areas. Additionally, they develop adequate proficiency in the English language. The PRISMA curriculum includes opportunities for internships and traineeships at businesses and public organizations, and it is designed following the successful LM+ (Master's Degree "plus") formula already implemented by our University in other fields. Thanks to agreements with private companies and public entities, students have the opportunity to apply for paid internships, typically lasting 12 months and corresponding to 12 ECTS credits. The PRISMA Master's Degree program provides an educational path for graduates of the Bachelor's Degree in "Legal Sciences for Prevention and Security" and the Bachelor's Degree in "Legal Services Sciences," both offered by our Department. It is also naturally open to all graduates from legal degree programs at other universities (belonging to the L-14 or LMG-01 degree classes), as well as to graduates from other degree classes who have gained significant experience in the legal field (by acquiring at least 36 ECTS credits in legal disciplines, including at least 6 ECTS credits in IUS/01, 6 ECTS credits in IUS/04, 6 ECTS credits in IUS/10, and 6 ECTS credits in IUS/17).
