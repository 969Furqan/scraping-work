Starting from the Academic Year 2020/2021, a new professionalizing Bachelor’s Degree Program in Legal Sciences for Prevention and Security has been launched, organized in collaboration with the Carabinieri Corps.
The Program is specifically designed to train security professionals for public or private organizations: professionals capable of understanding the context and organization of a company, analyzing national and international scenarios, identifying and assessing risks, developing strategies, policies, and procedures for risk prevention, as well as recognizing and managing crisis and emergency situations. Due to its professionalizing focus, theoretical learning is complemented by practical training aimed at developing the necessary operational skills, thanks to the contribution of personnel from the Carabinieri Corps, the State Police, and the Financial Police, as well as security professionals.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The educational objective of the degree course in "Security and Prevention Sciences" is to train "security managers" or similar / complementary professional figures (auditors), intended as legal operators with specific transversal skills in the field of internal and external security and "capable of preventing, responding to, and resolving events that are prevalently intentional and / or
of a negligent nature, which may damage the material, intangible, organizational and human resources (UNI 10459)" of a company or of a wider social context.
To achieve this objective, theoretical learning and a solid legal knowledge of fundamental institutions is progressively accompanied both by practical training activities and by specialized disciplinary instruction suitable for developing that complementarity of functional skills for solving different applicative problems that the security professional must know how
to identify and manage.
To this end, basic legal training is mainly concentrated in the first two years of the degree course: first-year subjects are of a
fundamental nature and, while organised according to the peculiarity of the educational objectives of the course of study, they provide the necessary conceptual, lexical and terminological tools for students to be able to reach an adequate competence in
institutional matters typical of the juridical area. They are flanked by other disciplines suitable for developing the student’s ability to assimilate knowledge in the historical-philosophical, economic and linguistic fields.
Subsequently, the training course covers specific thematic areas that fall within the functions of the "security manager", such as
the protection of IT security; the protection of privacy; the prevention and repression of corruption; the protection of the environment and safety in the workplace and, in general, everything related to compliance and risk management. The training programe is rendered complete by courses that pertain to thematic areas traditionally belonging to the legal area, such as commercial law, criminal law and criminal procedure.
The most specialized or technical-operational training activities are placed, at the end of the course of study, with the aim of providing further professionalizing skills and the acquisition of specific technical skills. Various thematic areas concerning the protection of external and internal security are explored, such as information security, criminology, investigative techniques, and the history and organization of the police force.
The educational offer is also enriched by the possibility of choosing between different complementary courses, in the sociological, economic, linguistic and legal fields, in order to obtain multidisciplinary knowledge and skills that not only complete the study path, but at the same time guarantee suitable flexibility in modulating and personalising educational enrichment.
The learning of English is ensured within the degree course both on the basis of the mastery of legal and technical-operational
terminology, and for the purpose of acquiring skills for the development, communication and management of information and
documentation using IT and telematic tools and methods. In order to enrich the cultural preparation of graduates who are called to
work in an increasingly globalized context, the possibility of acquiring knowledge of a second language is also offered.
There are 6 university credits awarded for internships and training stages aimed at developing and acquiring professional
experience in the sectors of public and private enterprise, state and local public administration and law enforcement.
Career opportunities
Graduates from this degree course work mainly for private companies, though also for public bodies. 
They can operate at different organizational levels in the areas of protection and prevention: for the safety of workers, for the protection of privacy in the different contexts of data transfer, for the design of models of organization and management, for more effective relations with the public administration, for the prevention and combatting of forms of illegality that endanger movable goods, real estate, tangible and intangible goods, individuals, or the environment.
Admission requirements
The possession of a secondary school diploma or other qualification obtained abroad, recognized as suitable according to current laws, is required. A sufficient level of general culture is required, i.e. good logical-argumentative skills and linguistic understanding, as normally provided by upper secondary school. The Teaching Regulations indicate the knowledge required for access and the methods of verifying adequate preparation, as well as the additional training obligations provided for in cases where the verification is not positive.
