The Masterâ€™s Degree aims to train graduates with a comprehensive theoretical and methodological foundation in various disciplines of linguistics, highlighting the implications of such analysis within the broader context of cognitive, social, and communication sciences.
The program offers an in-depth exploration of both the theoretical analysis of language structure and its evolution, as well as potential practical applications. Key areas of focus include linguistic mediation, computational linguistics and NLP, language teaching (glottodidactics), and specialized translation.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The masters degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics; Linguistics and Modern Languages aims to provide an in-depth preparation in the various theoretical and methodological aspects of language and natural languages including the implications such analysis may have on the more broader context of cognitive, social and communication sciences.  Alongside a general education related to phonetic, morphological, syntactical, semantic and pragmatic analysis of natural languages ( completing the fundamental concepts previously studied ), students are also offered the opportunity to acquire an in-depth preparation in the main fields of linguistic research: analysis of linguistic variation, interlinguistic comparison ( linguistic typology, contrastive linguistics ), sociolinguistics, computational linguistics ( with particular reference to the creation and management of corpus linguistics ) , text linguistics, learning a second language, the translation, linguistics and philology of a specific language or language family.
The study programme also includes taking up or continuing with the study of one or more European or extra-European language with an aim to providing the student with the skills required in various interlinguistic and intercultural communication and mediation suited to diverse national and international sociolinguistic contexts.
The teachers of the department also favor the inclusion of undergraduates in their research projects, so as to give them the opportunity to acquire direct skills in this field.
Students of the two year masters degree are encouraged to undertake periods of study abroad, organised via international exchange programmes.  Similarly, teachers of foreign universities are regularly invited to perform at the department their mobility periods, in order to encourage greater opportunity for students to come into contact with different approaches to the issues studied.
