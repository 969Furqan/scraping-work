The Bachelor’s Degree in “Social Sciences for Global Challenges” is completely taught in English and aims to train future experts on global challenges, such as: biodiversity, health, climate change, population ageing, migrations and natural disasters. In the constant effort to develop strategies and responses to problems that affect a growing numbers of individuals and communities, international organizations and administrations increasingly need the contribution of the social sciences and their ability to take into account the links between the local and global levels, to engage in dialogue across administrative, legal, economic, political, health, and environmental dimensions that do not always communicate with each other, and to grasp the impact of these processes on the lives of individuals and groups. The Degree Program offers the analytical instruments and the knowledge needed to understand the causes, nature and development of political, economic, demographic, climate and healthcare related challenges, as well as the organizational competences to work effectively in public administrations and in international and national organizations. The program follows an interdisciplinary academic path, moving from more general to specific courses. This will enable students to use methods, theories and approaches from different disciplines. The program is structured around the following areas: political and social sciences, law, economics, history, statistics and foreign languages, with additional competences offered by anthropology, maths, epidemiology and complexity theory. This open access program requires a B2 level in English, which will need to be certified by providing a language certificate, by having completed a secondary school program in English, or by taking an entrance test. The Degree Program also requires participation in a non-selective entrance test to certify students’ general knowledge.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The course aims to offer the interdisciplinary tools of social sciences and administration to understand the causes, nature and developments of global political, economic, demographic, health and climate challenges that have an impact on contemporary societies at all levels (local, national and supranational) in an increasingly widespread and frequent way, together with the organizational skills to act effectively in the public administration sector,  international and national organisations and the third sector. The ability of the social sciences to account for the connections between the local and global levels, to create a dialogue between administrative, legal, economic, political, health and environmental dimensions that do not always communicate with each other, and to grasp the implications that these processes have in the lives of individuals and groups is increasingly required by international bodies and administrations that want to develop strategies and responses to problems that today involve a wide range of problems. increasing number of people and communities. The course will train experts capable of contributing to the effectiveness and operational excellence of public and private entities at an international level, with particular reference to those realities that deal with issues related to global socio-political challenges (such as, for example, climate change, biodiversity, health, growing inequalities, migration, population aging, etc.). The training offered is aimed at providing the student with the necessary tools to analyze and manage the legal, social, political and economic issues of complex organizations and to form critical judgments to interpret the direction of the changes taking place, with reference to the organizational models of both international organizations and the main private structures, called upon to carry out increasingly important public interests (service companies,  non-profit associations, social enterprises, etc.). The training course includes the development of multidisciplinary skills in the historical, political, statistical, legal, sociological, economic, anthropological and linguistic fields, with the addition of mathematical, epidemiological and complexity studies:
A) Historical - Political - Social Area: the course will offer in the first year the general theoretical and methodological bases of contemporary history, political science, sociology and anthropology, offering insights into how these disciplines interpret global phenomena and their impact at the local level. In the years following the first, these theoretical and methodological tools will be applied to the issues of the environment, biodiversity and health.
B) Legal Area: the courses related to this area will provide students with an adequate basic training on the legal aspects underlying issues related to emergency communication, environmental sustainability and health, analyzing the local and international regulatory frameworks that permeate and articulate public policies in these areas.
C) Economic Area: also on this front, both the basics of economics and more in-depth skills on the issues of globalization, sustainability and crisis management are provided.
D) Language Area: the course, entirely delivered in English, will offer compulsory teaching in the first year to strengthen specialist and professional communication skills in English. Students will then learn an additional European or non-European language among the many offered by the University.
E) Statistical-Demographic and Mathematical Area: the course offers both basic mathematical knowledge useful for understanding statistical models applied to the social sciences and more detailed knowledge about the collection and reading of complex data.
The graduate will also develop the language and communication skills necessary to be able to convey information and project objectives in academic and non-academic contexts, both in Italy and abroad. These skills will also be developed thanks to the possibility of participating in the many international mobility programs (Erasmus study, Erasmus traineeship, exchanges to the United States and other non-European countries) offered by the University of Pavia. For foreign students, there is a training activity for the learning of the Italian language. The graduate will develop and perfect the ability to autonomously deepen complex and articulated topics through the critical use of a multiplicity of sources; They will also be able to expand and consolidate the knowledge acquired and will have developed the flexibility necessary to acquire new knowledge.
The course of study offers both a basic training (through the courses of the first year that offer the fundamental theoretical tools of the individual disciplines) and a more characterizing training, thanks to courses that allow the student to acquire (in the second and third year) a more in-depth preparation of the topics that characterize the degree course.
The training activities of the course of study are also aimed at allowing the acquisition of transversal skills useful for operating in multidisciplinary and international contexts, to promote teamwork and to contextualize the needs and problems of the institutions in which they operate, helping to identify the most appropriate solutions.
The educational path guarantees a wide range of choices for the student, demonstrated by the high number of free credits and the possibility of choosing between different courses. There are also 6 credits for internships and internships at qualified national and international institutions aimed at the development and acquisition of professional experience in the sectors relevant to the topics of the course. The course will be completed at the end of the third year with the final dissertation.
Career opportunities
