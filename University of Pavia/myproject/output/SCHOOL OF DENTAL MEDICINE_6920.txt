Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The objective of the Master's Degree Course in Dentistry and Dental Prosthetics is to train a professional to be capable of carrying out the dental profession. The general objectives and the structure of the teaching system described below refer to the contents of the new scheme of the Ministerial Decree New Degree Classes - Discipline of master's degree courses, which defines the master's degree courses in compliance with the Union directives European Union, to the University Teaching Regulations of the University of Pavia, to the LAW 8 November 2021, n. 163 and Interministerial Decree no. 653 of 5-7 2022. The educational system provides for the acquisition of 360 University Education Credits (CFU) in 6 years. The distribution of the 360 training credits is determined in compliance with the conditions reported in the annexes of the decree, which establishes the credits to be attributed to the disciplinary areas including training activities 'essential' to the training of the dentist. Pursuant to Interministerial Decree no. 653 of 5-7 2022 and by the LAW of 8 November 2021, at least 30 CFU will be acquired through a practical-evaluative internship, i.e. a professional training course aimed at the acquisition of specific diagnostic and clinical-therapeutic skills and abilities in the field of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of odontostomatological diseases, relating to the disciplines of oral surgery, restorative dentistry, endodontics, implantology, oral pathology and medicine, pediatric dentistry, special dentistry, orthodontics, periodontology and prosthetics. The holders of professional teaching courses are responsible for the internship relating to teaching. The physiopathological and clinical knowledge of general medicine and odontostomatology acquired with the training activities included in the teaching plan and the practical clinical activities determine and define the professional profile of the dentist working in the countries of the European Union. At the end of the six years, the master's graduate in dentistry and dental prosthetics must have acquired the knowledge, technical skills and practical preparation to enter professionally in both the private and public dental field. The graduate must also have developed the learning skills necessary to undertake specialized studies. The graduate must be able to carry out activities relating to the prevention, diagnosis and therapy of congenital and acquired diseases and anomalies of the teeth, mouth, jaw bones, temporomandibular joints and related tissues, as well as dental rehabilitation, prescribing all the medicines and aids necessary for the practice of the profession. The graduate must possess a level of professional, cultural, decision-making and operational autonomy such as to allow constant updating, having followed a training path characterized by a holistic approach to the oral health problems of the healthy or sick person, also in relation to the physical environment and the society that surrounds it. In general aspects, the first two years is aimed at the study of basic training activities aimed at making the student aware of the fundamentals of the structure and vital functions of the human body and includes courses that address issues related to the doctor-patient relationship and the understanding of the principles which are the basis of scientific methodology. The student also learns the method for dealing with patients with oral-dental problems. The following three years involves the study of disciplines of medical, surgical and specialist interest with particular reference to clinical problems related to odontostomatological pathologies. These training activities take place simultaneously with the study of dental disciplines and the professionalizing clinical internship. Having acquired knowledge on large systems during the first two years and understood the etiopathogenetic principles underlying organic, functional and homeostatic alterations, the anatomopathological pictures of the most common diseases are evaluated and the general principles of pharmacological and anesthetic sciences are introduced. The sixth year involves the acquisition of specific diagnostic and clinical-therapeutic skills and abilities, particularly through clinical and practical-evaluative training (TPV). The CFU relating to the TPV can only be acquired through activities carried out as a first operator, under the direct control of a teacher-tutor, at university facilities or the National Health Service following an agreement. Pursuant to Art. 2 Paragraph 9 of Interministerial Decree no. 653 of 5-7 2022, the TPV credits are acquired in the sixth year of the course and a quota not exceeding 30 percent of the total can be acquired in the fifth year of the course.
