Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The international degree course in Artificial Intelligence (given in English) is specifically aimed at training experts in the theoretical foundations, techniques, methodologies, and methods of application of artificial intelligence to contribute in a targeted way to the dissemination and advancement of knowledge and skills in this discipline and in the sectors of application, thereby promoting technological innovation and contributing to the economic and social development of the country. Graduates will gain strongly interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in a variety of areas that characterize the courses of study in artificial intelligence in international best practices. The graduate will receive a solid training in the fundamentals of some areas of computer science, mathematics, physics, statistics, and the cognitive sciences, specifically focusing attention on those areas that will allow them to understand the theoretical bases and techniques of artificial intelligence. They will also receive the ethical and legal training necessary to understand the constraints that limit the socially acceptable use of these techniques. In the final phase of the course, they will have the opportunity to choose, based on their personal goals, to enrich this thorough common basic knowledge with additional knowledge and skills useful for applying artificial intelligence in specific areas, such as communication, automation and robotics, cognitive sciences, and technologies for physics. The graduate will therefore be able to contribute, based on constantly updated interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, to the design and implementation of innovative solutions based on artificial intelligence techniques both in the public and private sectors. The degree course thus includes training activities aimed both at understanding the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and at experimenting with its use in applications. To this end, it is structured with a series of activities aimed at providing the knowledge and developing the skills necessary for entering the world of work. The degree course is structured as follows:
- the first two years are normally totally devoted to activities dedicated to the core training in artificial intelligence, which are mandatory for all students; 
- the third year is partially dedicated to the experimentation of artificial intelligence in areas of application through training activities suggested to students depending on the area of application they have chosen from among those offered by the degree course;
- typically, in the third year, students can freely choose courses according to their educational interests;
- in the third year, students normally complete the practical understanding of artificial intelligence, also in the applied areas, through practical-experimental teaching activities and/or internships;
- the course of study is completed at the end of the third year with the final thesis.
