The professional degree program in Digital Technologies for Construction, Environment, and Territory will train professionals with a cultural profile rooted in the traditional figure of the Surveyor but expanded to include topics such as: energy efficiency, structural safety, territory protection, monitoring of territory, artifacts, and infrastructure, workplace safety, mediation and conflict management, and real estate valuation. The profile of the trained technicians will be intermediate between the executive and the design roles typical of traditional engineering degrees. The entire course of study will have a strong focus on digitization and the IT management of projects and activities.
The degree program includes a single track that comprises both basic and specialized courses with a strong presence of laboratory activities and a third year dedicated to an internship at professional studios, companies, construction firms, or public entities. Moreover, given the professional nature of the degree program, various courses and laboratories will aim to prepare students to obtain certifications such as ICDL Standard, CAD 2D and GIS; BIM Specialist; Safety Coordinator in construction sites; and Energy Certifier.

Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The TeDCAT Bachelor's Degree Course will train graduate surveyors qualified for registration with the Board of Surveyors and Graduate Surveyors, with a cultural profile focused on three main areas: land surveying, construction, territorial planning, and valuation. The curriculum also includes topics such as energy efficiency, workplace and worksite safety, land protection, land, building, and infrastructure monitoring, workplace safety, property valuation, and asset management. The entire course will have a strong orientation towards digitization and computerized project and activity management. Various computer programs useful for the activities of trained professionals will be taught in courses and, especially, in laboratories: CAD software, BIM, GIS, topographic surveying, energy certification; advanced use of spreadsheets for technical calculations, reporting, and quantity surveying will be taught. The use of digital tools for land surveying and monitoring, such as digital and motorized total station, GNSS receivers, lidar, and drones, will be taught. The proposed Bachelor's Degree Course curriculum is essentially rigid, with the exception of 12 CFU to be freely chosen from the University's educational offerings. Credits are allocated for core subjects, in a limited number. Credits are assigned to core and related subjects, as specified in the tables in the following sections. There are 48 CFU dedicated to laboratory activities. Finally, 48 CFU are assigned to the practical-evaluative internship (PEI), carried out at affiliated facilities, aimed at exposing students to the typical practices of the graduate surveyor profession. Teaching at TeDCAT will have original characteristics. It will be rigorous, as is typical of university teaching, and at the same time oriented towards applications. The use of mathematical formalism will be kept to a minimum. The main focus will be on how to tackle different study subjects using selected hardware and software tools. Courses will not be limited to teaching the mere operation of tools but will aim to train qualified technicians capable of supporting projects (surveying, structural calculation, representation, safety, and construction site). Given the professionalizing nature of the Bachelor's Degree Course, several courses and laboratories will, among their various objectives, prepare students to obtain certain certifications: ICDL (International Certification of Digital Literacy) Standard; ICDL CAD 2D; ICDL GIS; BIM Specialist; Construction Safety Coordinator (CSE); Energy Certifier. Professionalizing degree courses do not naturally lead to enrollment in a master's degree, although this is not explicitly prohibited by the regulations. The natural outcome is entering the workforce.
Career opportunities
Graduate Surveyor.

Skills in the use of digital technologies and in the management of digital processes in civil and environmental engineering are highly sought after by the market. The transition from traditional systems of design and management of civil works to digital systems and systems based on BIM technologies is underway, and the demand for professionals capable of operating with these new systems is significant. A similar transition is occurring in the field of cartography, spatial planning, and land management: the demand for professionals capable of operating appropriately with GIS technologies is strong. Therefore, professional opportunities may include:

- Private technical firms involved in the design and management of civil works
- Private technical firms specializing in topographic surveying and land monitoring
- Construction companies
- Public technical organizations
- Companies supplying systems, services, and components for civil and environmental engineering
- Professional studios operating in the field of civil and environmental engineering, urban planning, valuation, and territorial informatics

Enrollment in a master's degree program is not a natural progression for graduates.
Admission requirements
It is required high school diploma or another equivalent foreign qualification recognized as suitable. Additionally, the knowledge and skills required are:
- Logical reasoning skills
- Ability to apply basic mathematics and principles of experimental sciences
The verification of the possession of the entry knowledge, mandatory according to D.M. 270/04, will take place according to the methods specified in the educational regulations of the course of study, where any Additional Training Obligations required in case of negative verification will also be indicated, to be fulfilled in the first year of the course.
