Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
Graduates in Biomedical Laboratory Techniques are experts in the technical-diagnostic field of the healthcare sector. They are highly qualified specialists able to perform biomedical and biotechnological analyses for diagnostic purposes in analysis and research laboratories. They have a role of direct responsibility on the outcome of the analyses, while ensuring a high standard of quality throughout the entire analytical process.
The achievement of these professional skills takes place through a training course that focuses on solid training in the disciplines introductory courses such as physics, chemistry and statistics, as well as in biological disciplines such as molecular biology, genetics, cytology, human anatomy and physiology. It is also essential to acquire knowledge in biomedical disciplines such as general pathology, in order to learn analytical methods and procedures characteristics of the scientific context.
The course must provide the student with the basics for the knowledge of biological and pathological phenomena, the methodological bases of analytical processes for analyses chemical-clinical, microbiological and laboratory hematology. Teaching must be aimed at the acquisition and understanding of the most common notions pharmacotoxicology and immunology, immunohaematological, immunometric and radio-immunological techniques, histocytopathology with particular emphasis on
to the most innovative and latest generation methodologies. The course of study must also teach the principles of operation and maintenance of the analytical, quality control, safety in the workplace and radiation protection instrumentation.
Multiple educational objectives will be achieved or completed through internship activities. During the internships, students will be instructed to perform, in close collaboration with the graduate laboratory staff responsible for the various operational activities, various practical services that replicate those of future employment professional. In this context, they will acquire skills related to the accurate execution of analytical procedures and their role within their functions, following the work protocols defined by the managers in charge of the structures operating in the area.
At the end of the degree course, students must have achieved the following educational objectives in order to possess:
- a good knowledge of the fundamentals of the preparatory disciplines;
- a good knowledge of the methods and procedures characterizing the profession of the Biomedical Laboratory Technician. More specifically, they concern:
Chemical analysis techniques and chemical-clinical analysis, investigation methodology and microbiological techniques, pathological anatomy techniques, biochemistry techniques
clinical pathology and hematology techniques. Pharmacotoxicological, biotechnological, immunohematological analyses are also included.
biological-molecular, immunometric, radioimmunological, genetic, anatomical-cyto-histopathological;
- bioinformatics knowledge to be able to organize and consult databases, manage electronic information;
- knowledge of integrative and related disciplines in the field of bioethics and health management sciences;
- the scientific method and be able to apply it in any real situation of competence, with sufficient knowledge of the regulations and problems of medical-legal, deontological and bioethical matters;
- ability to relate to other operators in the sector or other sectors and with colleagues and other professionals not necessarily in health fields;
- ability to work in a team, to operate with defined degrees of autonomy and to fit readily into the work environment;
- knowledge necessary to use methodologies and tools for quality control, evaluation and review;
- ability to assess exposure to radioactive tracers during analytical procedures and implement radiation protection measures;
- skills to participate in the various forms of professional development and to participate in research activities in the various areas of application of the profession;
- ability to use the English language, in the specific field of competence and in the exchange of general information;
- skills for a correct and comprehensible communication of information and results, including technical-scientific reports;
- knowledge of security procedures;
TRAINING
1ST YEAR
Preparatory and basic knowledge of Chemistry and Biochemistry, in-depth study of Human Systematic Biochemistry and Methodologies are provided.
Biochemical. In addition to Anatomy and Physiology, the basic courses also include Genetics and Prenatal Diagnostics, Histology and General Pathology.
The courses of Radiation Protection and Radiobiology, Statistics for Research and the modules of the Integrated Course of Human Sciences and
Management, while they are included in the basic courses Toxicology and Pharmacology and Computer Science.
During the first year, compulsory activities include the English language course, the attendance of professional workshops and one or more seminars on specialist topics.
The professional internship is attended at the university laboratories. During this period the student acquires the basic notions of the profession:
dilutions, preparation of solution and culture media.
2ND YEAR
The program focuses on the deepening of fundamental subjects such as Microbiology, Virology and Parasitology, Hematology and Immunohematology.
In addition, the techniques of Histochemistry and Immunostichemistry, Cytopathology and Molecular Biology focused on Pathological Anatomy are thoroughly examined.
The internship begins with exposure to 'routine' laboratories and subsequently extends to specialized laboratories within the hospital, under the guidance of tutor. Students begin with the initial management of instrumentation, programming and analysis of quality control results, and then supervise the adequacy of requests and samples sent. This approach allows students to put into practice the knowledge they have acquired and Begin to familiarize yourself with the reality of work.
3RD YEAR
Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics are extensively explored, as well as Quality Control, Forensic Medicine and Toxicology and Occupational Medicine. Automation and Computerization are also among the core subjects, together with the course on Electrical Measurements and Electronic. The plan includes a variety of courses chosen by the student, both theoretical and theoretical-practical, which are regularly updated.
The internship, also aimed at the realization of the final paper, involves a close collaboration with scientific research projects carried out in the laboratory in which it takes place. At the end of the course, the student will have acquired complete professional skills and will be ready for an effective and rapid integration into the workplace.
Career opportunities
Employment opportunities can be identified:
- In the various specialist areas of the Hospital and Out-of-Hospital Laboratories belonging to the National Health Service and in similar private and Scientific Institutes of Hospitalization and Care (IRCCS).
- In quality control laboratories in the biomedical field and the pharmaceutical industry.
- In the analysis and control laboratories of the Regional Agencies for the prevention and protection of the environment.
- In manufacturing industries and marketing agencies operating in the field of laboratory diagnostics.
- In university and non-university research laboratories in the biomedical sector.
- In the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institutes of the Regions for the prevention of diseases of animal origin for the hygienic-sanitary supervision of control staff foods also of animal origin.
Admission requirements
Candidates in possession of an upper secondary school diploma, required by current legislation, or other qualifications are admitted to the degree courseobtained abroad deemed eligible. Admission to the degree course is limited by the scheduling of admissions at national level Art.1 Law of 2 August
