Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
The proposed master's degree course aims to offer a broad historical panorama of the various civilizations that developed on the shores of the Mediterranean, between the Bronze Age and the end of the Western Roman Empire (from the Levant and from Anatolia to Egypt, from Greece to the Italian Peninsula), investigated and illustrated with privileged, but not exclusive, use of archaeological sources. Archeology will therefore be understood as a historical discipline of artefacts and landscapes and will also include, among its fields of application, the history of art or rather of ancient arts, according to a traditional and still qualifying characterization of Italian school studies. This is a training course (120 credits) with a single curriculum, of an essentially historical-cultural nature, which aims to deepen in an archaeological sense a basic antiquity preparation, also with a view to subsequent access to a specialization school and/or a master's degree. second level in the field of cultural heritage. The predominant historical-cultural component of the training offer is in fact ensured by teachings in which the history/civilization combination is expressed in diversified chronological and territorial meanings; while the technical-methodological skills (also in the sense of IT tools) will be achieved through targeted teaching and internship experiences on construction sites and/or in museums; and museological-management ones, through the particular teaching method adopted, which will also include off-site teaching activities and guided visits to archaeological parks and museums, including, for example, the Egyptian Museum of Turin. The course of study, which is intended for use by students of international origin, is entirely taught in English, so that upon entry the requirement is a level of English language proficiency no lower than B2. However, its training objectives also include the acquisition of "further linguistic knowledge" in the Italian language for students whose mother tongue is not Italian. Alternatively, native Italian speaking students will acquire "further linguistic knowledge" through teaching aimed at improving their English writing skills.
Career opportunities
Archaeologist and historian of the arts of the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean world: The acquired preparation allows the master's graduate: - to work in collaboration with and to join companies and cooperatives providing archaeological services; - to be involved in study and research bodies and units engaged in the conservation of the archaeological, artistic, documentary and monumental heritage, both in public (but not state: Municipalities, Provinces, Regions) and private (foundations) bodies and institutions; - to conduct archaeological research on the land (surface prospecting and excavations) upon authorization and on behalf of the bodies responsible for protection, as an individual or within professional associations; - to carry out scientific communication activities in the field of archaeological themes, both through the press and through multimedia tools; - to participate in competitions for the profession of tourist guide; - to access specialization school, research doctorate and second level master's degree. As already noted above ("function in a work context"), it is important to underline that the positions of archaeological official, in inspection and management (state), museum and protection roles of archaeological sites and monuments, require in Italy, in addition in addition to the master's degree, there is also a specialization and/or doctorate diploma in the archaeological field. The latter is also essential for access to a possible academic career in the sector.
