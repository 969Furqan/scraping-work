Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
Graduates in Obstetrics are health professionals who carry out activities aimed at the prevention, treatment and protection of women's health by carrying out their functions identified by the rules establishing the relevant professional profile as well as the specific code of ethics and using planning methodologies for obstetric, gynecological and neonatal care objectives. The student in obstetrics must acquire knowledge and skills regarding sexual/reproductive events related to the biological cycle of women, from adolescence to climacteric. Applying the knowledge of psychology and pedagogy acquired, he/she must be able to manage the relationship with the woman in pregnancy, labor/delivery, puerperium and with the woman undergoing surgery for benign and malignant pathology of the genital system. At the end of the course, he/she must be able to work in multidisciplinary teams with ethics and responsibility. In fact, the student in the first year deals with the basic disciplines with the general objective of acquiring an adequate preparation, such as to allow him both the best understanding of the most relevant elements, individual and gender, which reside at the basis of the physiological processes and transit to pathology - to which his preventive, diagnosis/support/maintenance of physiology and complementary intervention is aimed - and the maximum integration,  cultural and welfare, with other disciplines. Basic activities include Preparatory Sciences and Biomedical Sciences.
In the second year of the course, the general objective is to acquire knowledge on the physiological phenomena of the obstetric, gynaecological and neonatal areas, drawing on the disciplinary areas of Obstetric Sciences (Med/47), Medical-Surgical Sciences, Prevention, Interdisciplinary and Clinical Sciences for the characterizing activities.
In the third year of the course, the general objective is to teach the student the pathological phenomena and the related treatment processes in obstetrics, gynecology and neonatology, drawing on the disciplinary areas of Medical-Surgical Sciences, Obstetric Sciences (Med/47), Interdisciplinary and Clinical Sciences, Prevention, Health Management, Human and Psycho-pedagogical Sciences for the characterizing activities.
As far as the specific objectives are concerned, these are outlined by the contents of Ministerial Decree 740/1994 and Legislative Decree 206/2007, art. 48 and its amendments by Legislative Decree 28 January 2015. The following are the specific disciplines with the corresponding didactic contents:
At the end of the training course, students must be able to assist and advise the woman during pregnancy, during childbirth and in the puerperium, conduct and carry out eutocic births on their own responsibility and provide assistance to the newborn. This preventive assistance, diagnosis/support/maintenance of the physiological state, emergency, palliative and rehabilitative care is of a technical, relational and educational nature. Graduates in Midwifery, as far as they are competent, participate in health and sex education interventions both within the family and in the community; psychoprophylactic preparation for childbirth; preparation and assistance for gynaecological procedures; the prevention and detection of cancers of the female genital sphere; maternal and neonatal care programs. Graduates also manage, in compliance with professional ethics and as members of the health team, the care interventions under their competence; They are able to identify potentially pathological situations that require medical intervention and to practice, where necessary, the relevant emergency measures.
The knowledge of the theoretical and methodological aspects will then be developed and deepened through the laboratory activity and the professional internship activity during which the student will reach full professional autonomy. They must also be able to use at least English in addition to Italian, in the specific field of competence and for the exchange of general information as well as elements of computer science.
