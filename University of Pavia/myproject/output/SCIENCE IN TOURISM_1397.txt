The Tourism Sciences degree program (L15) is offered by the University of Pisa (administrative headquarters of the program), in collaboration with the University of Pavia, the University of Italian Switzerland, the Campus Foundation, the Municipality of Lucca, and the Cassa di Risparmio di Lucca Foundation.
It stems from a concept of tourism as a complex economic, social, communicative, and intercultural dialogue phenomenon. Within this continuously evolving context, the program aims to train professionals with an adequate multidisciplinary preparation, capable of intercepting the main directions of innovation and developing new tourism proposals and cutting-edge services. Specifically, the program aims to:
offer solid knowledge in the various subjects involving the tourism phenomenon (humanities, economics, law, and management);
apply the acquired methodologies through workshops, laboratory activities, and group work under the guidance of industry experts;
stimulate curiosity and an aptitude for tourism, with particular attention to individual soft skills;
enhance language skills in the tourism field.
