Overview of the program, goals and career opportunities
Educational goals
On conclusion of the three year degree course graduates must be able to : - manage and operate the computerised systems for the transmission and processing of cardiological examinations – Manage the technical execution of the echocardiogram examination complete with quantitative assessment and echoflowmetry of the cardiac and/or vascular systems – Carry out diagnostic procedures in outpatients’ clinics with the assistance, where necessary, of telemedicine and cardiac telemetric instruments – Manage cardiocirculatory and respiratory assistance – Use normothermic and hyperthermic extracorporeal methods for pelvic, peritoneal, thoracic, limbs and liver antiblastic therapy – Implement protocol for organ preservation and transport – Apply the techniques of extracorporeal dialysis – Manage intraoperative plasmapheresis methods and platelet gel and fibrin glue preparation – Operate and provide maintenance of equipment used in extracorporeal circulatory techniques and hemodynamic and non-invasive cardiology techniques – Manage equipment used for electrocardiography, electrocardiography stress tests, dynamic electrocardiography (holter) and memory systems of Brady-arrhythmia episodes – Guarantee the correct application of requested diagnostic and therapeutic prescriptions – Independently manage the extracorporeal circulation and hemodynamic methods of patients artificially obtained via the heart-lung machine – Guarantee blood oxygenation and systemic perfusion – Apply cerebral protection techniques during operations where cerebral vessels are involved – Update medical files with extracorporeal circulation data – Take decisions in accordance with the legal, ethical and deontologic principles which regulate health care organisations and professional responsibility – Take part in compiling guidelines to apply to procedures performed in respect of clinical-risk-management – Implement quality assessment and revision tools and methodologies – Communicate effectively with patients and interested parties the information related to your area of expertise regarding their state of health – Contribute to teaching and tutorial activities – Recognise and respect the role and expertise of all members of the healthcare team and establish a positive collaborative relationship with them – Actively interact and collaborate with inter-professional teams – Develop health education and prevention programmes .

First year programme of studies: - aimed at providing core biomedical and preventative hygiene knowledge, the fundamentals of the professional discipline required in order to take part in the practical training experience aimed at guiding the student and in acquiring fundamental expertise.
Second year – aimed at an in-depth study of cardiology operations, vascular diagnostics, pneumology, thoracic surgery and paediatric and adult surgery.  Students will acquire professional competence in performing cardiography examinations, cardiorespiratory functioning assessment tests and extracorporeal circulation in both adults and children.
Practical clinical training is provided in various contexts giving the students the opportunity to experiment knowledge and theories learned.
Third year – aimed not only at specialist in-depth study but also acquiring the knowledge and methodologies relevant to professional practice and the ability to work in a team within complex organisational contexts.  Increasing importance is given to supervised practical training, leading to independence and responsibility. Students will acquire skills in scientific research methodologies, essential for thesis preparation.
Career opportunities
Graduates of Cardiovascular physiopathology techniques and cardiovascular perfusion can find employment, both as employees or freelance, in hospital and university departments or in private institutions working in the field of cardiac surgery, performing extracorporeal circulation in the field of oncology for localised antiblastic treatment, carrying out echocardiogram examinations, hemodynamic and cardiac catheterisation, instrumental diagnostics in outpatients’ clinics ( via telemedicine ) , in manufacturing industries and sales agencies within the sector, in university and research centres, in the biomedical sector.  This course also prepares for the healthcare technician profession.
Admission requirements
Candidates who possess a high school diploma or another foreign qualification recognized as suitable may be admitted to the Bachelor's Degree in Techniques of Cardiovascular Physiopathology and Cardiovascular Perfusion. Admission to the degree program is numerically limited according to Law 264/99 and involves an entrance examination consisting of a multiple-choice test. The dates and procedures for this examination are determined annually by the Ministry of Education, University, and Research and published in a specific notice issued by the university. Students admitted with a grade below the predetermined minimum will be assigned additional educational obligations. The procedures for recovering any educational deficits, which must be completed within the first year of the program, are regulated by the didactic regulations of the degree program.
