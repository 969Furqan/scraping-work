The Combined BS/MS in Computer Science (BS) and Computer Science (MS) is a combined bachelor/master degree program that provides students an opportunity to complete a bachelor’s and master’s degree in less time than would be required if the two degrees were done independently.
Students accepted for the BS/MS Program must have a minimum overall undergraduate GPA of 3.2. Students may apply to the BS/MS Program and be offered deferred admission to the graduate program during their junior year.
It is important that students register for the 12 credits of 5000-level classes that are double counted in order to satisfy the electives requirement for the Computer Science major as well as get credit towards the BS/MS Program. Any 5000-level CSI courses that are cross-listed with 4000-level CSI courses, with the approval of the CSE academic programs coordinator, will meet the requirement. If students take the 4000-level courses, those courses cannot be counted for the BS/MS degree.
Students offered deferred admission will remain classified as undergraduates until they have completed all undergraduate degree requirements. At that time, students who have maintained an overall undergraduate GPA 3.2 and have earned a 3.0 or above GPA in the double-counted graduate courses, will be reclassified as a graduate student through the Graduate School.
Specific offerings for each semester may be found in the
Schedule of Classes
.
To be eligible for the Computer Science, Combined B.S./M.S. option, students must:
Have a major GPA of 3.2 or above.
Apply for and receive delayed admission in the M.S. program and thereby the double-counting of three graduate classes (12 credits)
Maintain a minimum 3.2 cumulative GPA to completion of the degree in
Computer Science, B.S.
