Program description
Oakland University’s Master of Arts in Teaching in Secondary Education (MATSE) with K-12 Special Education program is designed for individuals who hold a bachelor’s degree in another field and are now seeking a career in teaching special education. The MATSE program is a 2-year teacher certification program that will prepare individuals for a career in teaching in grades K-12. The program combines teacher education coursework, three field placements in local schools, and a semester long (15-week) student teaching internship. Students have the option to complete the Emotional Impairment (EI) or the Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) concentration.
Program delivery
Courses are taken as a cohort with coursework beginning in the summer semester. First semester courses will be held in a hybrid format.  All in person components will be held on OU’s main campus no more than two weekday evenings per week. After the first semester, all coursework will be online. In addition to coursework, students are required to complete 100 hours of field experiences prior to student teaching. During the field placements, students will actively engage in the classroom, observe instruction and classroom management, work with small groups of students, and implement lessons. Field placements are arranged to afford students depth, breadth, and diversity of authentic learning experiences in schools where they can apply what they are learning in a real classroom.
