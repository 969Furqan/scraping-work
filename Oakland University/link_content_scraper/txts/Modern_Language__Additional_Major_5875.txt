General College of Arts and Sciences requirements

Schedule of Classes

General Education Requirements
In order to graduate on-schedule without taking additional courses, it is highly recommended that students meet with an Undergraduate Academic Adviser concerning the selection of all of their general education courses.
Each candidate for an Oakland University baccalaureate will need to satisfactorily complete approved courses in each of the following areas: Foundations, Explorations, and Integration. For details, refer to the
General Education Requirements
section of the catalog.
Requirements for the liberal arts major in a modern language with additional majors, B.A. program
Additional majors are available in Chinese, French, German, Japanese and Spanish for students with another major at Oakland University. The requirement is a minimum of 24 credits at the 3000-4000 level in the language being studied. At least 16 credits of those required for the additional liberal arts major in a modern language must be taken at Oakland University.
Regression Policy
Students will not receive credit for a lower sequence course after successful completion of a more advanced level course. For example, students will not receive credit for FRH 1140 (or transfer course equivalent) if taken after successful completion of FRH 1150.
