Program description
The Graduate Certificate in Corporate and Worksite Wellness is designed to offer advanced graduate courses to prepare exercise science practitioners for the demands of careers in corporate and worksite wellness. Worksite Wellness focuses on establishing and maintaining a healthy environment in the workplace, as well as in schools and the community.  The primary goal of Worksite Wellness is to promote and encourage employees to lead a healthy lifestyle. Wellness promotion is done through programming including, but not limited to, smoking cessation, biometric screenings, stress management, weight loss, back health/safety, and fitness classes. Successful worksite wellness programs show more productive employees, higher employee satisfaction, and lower absenteeism due to illness.

Satisfactory academic progress
Satisfactory academic progress (SAP) is the term used to denote a student’s successful completion of coursework toward a certificate or degree. Federal regulations require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor SAP for all financial aid recipients each semester.
Students who fall behind in their coursework, or fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and completion of classes, may lose their eligibility for all types of federal, state and university aid. Contact the
Office of Financial Aid
for additional details.
Good academic standing
All graduate students are expected to remain in
good academic standing
throughout the entire course of their graduate program. To be in good academic standing, a graduate student must make satisfactory progress toward fulfilling degree requirements, including the completion of critical degree milestones as set forth by the academic program. Department requirements: An overall GPA of 3.0 (B) or higher for all coursework taken in the professional program is required for graduation, and no grade below 2.7 (B-) may be applied toward this degree. For courses graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U), no coursework graded Unsatisfactory (U) may be applied to this degree.
Graduate students who are not in good academic standing for any reason are subject to probation and/or dismissal from further graduate study.
