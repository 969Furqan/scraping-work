Communication B.A. to M.A. Accelerated Program
The Communication B.A. to M.A. program enables students to earn a bachelor’s degree in Communication and a graduate M.A. degree in Communication simultaneously. This accelerated program allows students to complete three graduate level courses while pursuing the undergraduate degree and pay undergraduate rates for those courses.
It is recommended that students complete the core requirements and apply to the program at the end of the first semester of their junior year.
Admission Criteria
Admission to the Accelerated Communication B.A. to M.A. program is granted only by the department.
1. To be considered for admission students must complete the major core requirements in Communication:
COM 1000 - Introduction to Communication Studies
(4)
COM 3300 - Communication, Culture, and Belonging
(4)
COM 2000 - Public Speaking
(4)
or
COM 2001 - Professional Communication
(4)
COM 3000 - Relational Communication Theory
(4)
,  or
COM 3201 - Rhetorical Theory
(4)
, or
COM 3002 - Cultural Theory in Communication
(4)
, or
COM 3202 - Discourse Theory
(4)
2. Students must have an overall GPA of at least 3.0 and a GPA in the major of at least 3.3 to enter the program.
3. If approved for the program by the department, students will receive deferred admission status into the graduate M.A. program. Upon completion of the B.A. degree, students who have maintained an overall undergraduate GPA of 3.0 and earned a minimum grade of B- in each of their graduate courses will be formally admitted to the M.A. program.
If admitted to the program, 12-credits of graduate courses will apply to the bachelor’s degree and also count for graduate credit. Courses eligible to be double-counted must be at the 5000-level or 6000-level, and each must be passed with a minimum grade of B-. Independent study courses, internships or courses given for credit by examination are not eligible. Successful completion of major core requirements with a GPA of 3.0 does not guarantee admission.
Once accepted into the program, students will take COM 5002 (in place of the B.A. capstone); and two 5000 or 6000 level COM graduate courses (in place of two COM electives).
4. Students who opt not to continue on with full admission to the M.A. program in their senior undergraduate year must meet with a faculty adviser to ensure they have met the requirements for graduation.
How to Apply
Students who have completed the required courses with a minimum grade of B- must complete and submit a Declaration of Eligibility Form available on the Department’s web page as well as an application for the Master’s in Communication program.  The eligibility form must be emailed to the coordinator for the Master’s in Communication program.
*Transfer students are welcome and should see an advisor.
** Students must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 to remain in the accelerated degree program.
