Satisfactory academic progress
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is the term used to denote a student’s successful completion of coursework toward a certificate or degree. Federal regulations require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor Satisfactory Academic Progress for all financial aid recipients each semester.
Students who fall behind in their coursework, or fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and completion of classes, may lose their eligibility for all types of federal, state and university aid. Contact the
Office of Financial Aid
for additional details.
Good academic standing
All graduate students are expected to remain in
good academic standing
throughout
the entire course of their graduate program. To be in good academic standing, a graduate student must make satisfactory progress toward fulfilling degree requirements, including the completion of critical degree milestones as set forth by the academic program. The student must also maintain a minimum semester and overall GPA of 3.0.
Good academic standing is a requirement for:
Holding a Graduate Assistantship
Receiving a fellowship or scholarship
Advancing to candidacy for a graduate degree
Going on a leave of absence
Obtaining a graduate certificate or degree from Oakland University.
Additionally, graduate students must meet all department academic standards which may be more stringent than the minimum set forth by the University.
Department requirements
:  Students must earn a grade of B or above in each course required for the graduate certificate in order to qualify for the graduate certificate; students may repeat any course once in order to achieve the minimum grade for that course.
Academic probation
Students admitted to a graduate certificate program will be subject to the same policies governing academic progress for regularly matriculated MPA students.
Graduate students who are not in good academic standing for any reason are subject to probation and/or dismissal from further graduate study.

Plan of study
All accepted applicants, in consultation with the program coordinator, must develop a plan of study that details specific courses the students will use to satisfy their degree requirements. The plan of study must be approved by the faculty program adviser and submitted by the student to Oakland University Graduate School.
Master’s and graduate certificate students must submit a department-approved plan of study by the end of their first semester of graduate coursework. Doctoral students must submit an approved plan of study prior to completion of the first year of coursework. (See the
Graduate Student Responsibility
section of this catalog.)
Note:  Credit granted for successful completion of a course toward an undergraduate degree program may not be repeated for a graduate degree. If a substitution is approved, the minimum number of program-approved graduate credits will be required. A
Petition of Exception - OU Course Waiver/Substitution
requesting the substitution must be approved.
Number of graduate certificates
Students may earn more than one graduate certificate, but cannot use (double count) any specific course to meet the requirements of two graduate certificate programs.
Transfer credit
Up to 3 credits of graduate work taken at another institution may be transferred to Oakland to meet part of the 12-credit requirement; these credits may not be used toward another graduate certificate or degree program.
Course requirements
Courses used toward the graduate certificate requirements must be beyond those earned for the master’s degree.
Software skills
Students must have proficiency in the use of Microsoft Professional Suite (or comparable package) and use of the Internet; students deficient in these skills may take an approved PC skills course which will not apply toward the certificate program.
Academic probation
Students admitted to a graduate certificate program will be subject to the same policies governing academic progress for regularly matriculated M.P.A. students.
Academic progress
Students must earn a grade of 3.0 or above in each course required for the graduate certificate in order to qualify for the graduate certificate; students may repeat any course once in order to achieve the minimum grade for that course.
