Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering: The Oakland University Advantage
Oakland’s close partnerships with FCA, Siemens and other global leaders set our mechanical engineering degree apart from competing programs. These industry connections strengthen every aspect of your education in mechanical engineering at Oakland, from the strength of the faculty to the quality of research labs, professional internships and career opportunities.
Our
mechanical engineering program
offers:
Exceptional internships.
Mechanical engineering
students at Oakland routinely gain workplace experience with the Big Three automakers and global leaders in energy, defense, biomedical and other industries. More than 90 percent of our
mechanical engineering
majors complete at least one internship, building professional contacts that often lead directly to job offers.
Specialized training programs.
Oakland operates two unique
mechanical engineering
programs with industry partners. The CLIC-form program focuses on sheet metal forming technology, giving you specialized preparation for
mechanical engineering jobs
in manufacturing environments. The PowerTrain Readiness Engineering Program (PREP) includes summer internships at Fiat-Chrysler and part-time work during the school year, with partial tuition reimbursement for select students.
Experienced faculty.
You’ll learn from industry veterans who combine academic expertise with professional seasoning. All of our mechanical engineering courses are taught by Ph.D. faculty (not graduate students) in small classes that promote interaction between students and professors.
Hands-on training.
Our
mechanical engineering degree
is built around applied coursework that involves real-world
mechanical engineering
challenges. You’ll develop superior lab skills and become proficient in computer simulation, while collaborating on design projects with students in other
engineering degree
programs.
World-class labs.
The School of Engineering and Computer Science operates more than a dozen industry-caliber laboratories equipped with the same tools you’ll use in your first
mechanical engineering job
. Lab work is woven throughout the program, so you’ll have ongoing opportunities to work in professional-grade mechanical engineering facilities. Examples include the Automotive Tribology Center, Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Materials, Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab, and Optical Inspection and Non-Destructive Testing Lab.
What Can You Do With a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering?
Oakland University is one of the best places in the country to prepare for
jobs in mechanical engineering
. According to Gradreports.com (a website that tracks graduate earnings), Oakland University ranks in the top 10 nationally in starting
salaries for mechanical engineering
graduates. Within a year of graduation, 96 percent of our students have
jobs in mechanical engineering
or are pursuing a graduate
engineering degree
or a military career.
Employers in the automotive, defense and power industries actively recruit graduates of Oakland’s
mechanical engineering program
. Our students routinely get their first
job in mechanical engineering
with global leaders such as:
Fiat Chrysler
Ford
Brose
General Motors
BAE Systems
ZF North America
Our graduates work in a variety of
jobs in mechanical engineering
, with job titles such as calibration engineer, application engineer, mechanical design engineer, advanced development engineer and design release engineer.
Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering: What You’ll Learn
The
mechanical engineering degree
provides a comprehensive foundation in the mechanics of solids, thermodynamics, fluid and thermal energy, materials, manufacturing, mechanical systems, electrical circuits, computer programming and software applications. The program includes foundational courses in calculus, physics and chemistry. You’ll also take five introductory courses in engineering, electromechanical systems and computer science.
The following nine professional courses make up the academic core of the
mechanical engineering degree
:
Computer-Aided Design
Engineering Mechanics
Fluid and Thermal Energy Transport
Mechanics of Materials
Properties of Materials
Vibrations and Controls
Mechanical Systems Design
Energy Systems Analysis and Design
Senior
Mechanical Engineering
Design Project
The remaining credits in the mechanical engineering program consist of electives. You can distribute electives across multiple content areas, or cluster them to earn an optional specialization in automotive engineering, manufacturing or energy.
