Department Website
The Mechanical Engineering Department offers optional specializations in Automotive Engineering, Manufacturing, and Energy to students interested in broadening their knowledge in a specific area of mechanical engineering and wishing an area of specialization in their degree. Specializations are available to, but not required of, any student enrolled in the Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. The sequences of courses listed below for each specialization are taken to satisfy the professional electives requirement. Note that completing the Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization may require more than 128 credits. Students may earn only one specialization and the specialization must be completed as part of their degree. The specialization will be noted on the students’ transcript and diploma.
See
Mechanical Engineering, B.S.E.
and
adviser
for complete details on specialization.
Specific offerings for each semester may be found in the
Schedule of Classes
.

ME 5700 - Polymer Processing (4)
Major Standing
To enroll in 3000- or higher level courses and to become candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering with a major in Mechanical Engineering, students must gain major standing. An application for major standing should be submitted prior to intended enrollment in 3000- or higher level courses.  Forms may be obtained from the SECS Undergraduate advising office or from the SECS website. At the time that major standing is approved, students with majors of Pre-Mechanical Engineering will have their major changed to Mechanical Engineering. Approval of both a major standing application and change of major to Mechanical Engineering is required prior to enrolling in any 3000- or higher-level courses.
To gain major standing in Mechanical Engineering, students must:
A) have an average GPA of 2.0 in the following mathematics and science courses:
MTH 1554
,
MTH 1555
,
APM 2555
,
CHM 1440
,
PHY 1610
(or
PHY 1510
),
PHY 1620
(or
PHY 1520
).
B) have an average GPA of 2.0 in the following engineering core courses:
EGR 1200
,
EGR 1400
,
EGR 2400
,
EGR 2500
,
EGR 2600
,
EGR 2800
. Note that some mechanical engineering courses require a minimum grade of C in
EGR 2500
or
EGR 2800
.
C) have no more than two grades below C in the required courses in A and B above;
D) have not attempted any course listed in A and B above more than three times; and
E) have not repeated more than three different courses listed in A and B. Courses in which a W (withdrawal) grade is recorded will not be counted.
Conditional major standing may be granted in the semester in which the student will complete the courses listed in A and B above.
Performance requirements
Satisfactory completion of the program requires a GPA of at least 2.0 within each course group: mathematics and sciences, engineering core, and professional courses (including required professional subjects and professional electives) and a grade of C or better in the senior design capstone course (ME 4999 or ME 4998). Within professional courses, at most two grades below C are permitted, at most two different courses may be repeated, and a total of three repeat attempts per course are permitted.
