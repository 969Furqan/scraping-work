Department Website
The Combined BS/MAcc is a combined bachelor/master degree program that provides high-achieving students an opportunity to complete a bachelor’s and master’s degree in less time than would be required if the two degrees were done independently. It is designed for students who are high academic achievers and creates an integrated learning experience along several knowledge paths. The BS/MAcc program students will be able to earn their master’s degree by completing no more than 9 credits of graduate courses (ACC 5150, ACC 5220, and ACC 5240) beyond the undergraduate Accounting major requirements.
Students accepted for the BS/MAcc program must have a minimum overall undergraduate GPA of 3.2. Students may apply to the BS/MAcc Program and be offered deferred admission to the graduate program during their junior year. BS/MAcc applicants may request to waive the GMAT requirement. To be eligible for the waiver, applicants must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. To request a waiver, download, complete, and submit the Request to Waive GMAT Form. This form is found under Supplemental Application, School of Business Administration.
It is important that students register for the 5000-level classes that are double counted in order to satisfy the electives requirement for the Accounting major as well as get credit towards the BS/MAcc program. If students take only the 4000-level electives, those courses cannot be counted for the BS/MAcc degree.
Students offered deferred admission will remain classified as undergraduates until they have completed all undergraduate degree requirements. At that time, students who have maintained an overall undergraduate GPA 3.2 and have earned a B or above in the double-counted graduate courses, will be reclassified as a graduate student through Graduate School.
Specific offerings for each semester may be found in the
