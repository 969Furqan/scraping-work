Histotechnology
Within
the
Department of Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences
, choose to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences with a specialization in Histotechnology (HT). Histotechnologists are responsible for applying proper histological techniques that involve processing, sectioning and staining of tissue specimens that have been removed from humans or animals by biopsy, surgical procedures or autopsy. This specialization prepares you to perform a variety of diagnostic and research procedures in the anatomic sciences. Through hands-on experience, you will learn how to
assess real case studies and work with human samples to apply and execute the skills used in clinical practice. You can ultimately earn a clinical internship to complete your education.

Curriculum
The pre-clinical education consists of 2-4 years of prerequisite and specialized classroom instruction meant to establish competencies in core scientific disciplines.
The
Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences major requires a cumulative GPA of 2.80 or higher for all specializations. Reviewing the Undergraduate Catalog (see
Curricular Requirements
) for CDS core curriculum and course grade expectations is required.
Clinical Internship
Students may apply for specialization standing in Histotechnology after completing the CDS core curriculum as listed in the
Undergraduate Catalog
, generally at the end of the sophomore year. The junior year consists of the specialization course requirements at Oakland University and the senior year includes the completion of a 12-month internship at an approved hospital based program. The internship includes instruction on advanced techniques such as: muscle enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and immunoenzyme procedures, in situ hybridization, image analysis and medical photography. Techniques in education methodology, management, research, technical writing and presentation of scientific information are also included in the curriculum.
Application to the hospital-based clinical internship is made during the winter semester of the sophomore year. Oakland University is affiliated with the accredited histotechnology clinical program at
Beaumont Health System
. Acceptance into the internship program is competitive and is based on grade point average, personal interview and letters of recommendation. Desirable candidates possess qualities/abilities in communication, computer literacy, leadership, multitasking, problem solving, and critical thinking.
Experience-Based Learning

Job Outlook
While the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) does not collect data on histotechnologists specifically, they are included under the broader occupational group of medical and clinical laboratory technologists. BLS reports that jobs in this category are projected to increase 5% from 2022 to 2032.
Average Salary
The salary for histotechnologists varies according to their level and location. According to the
American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) 2021 Wage Survey of Clinical Laboratories
in the United States, the staff level HTL national mean salary is $61,784.77 per year and $88,679.26 per year at the supervisory level.
Consider this profession if you:
are fascinated by science
enjoy solving problems
like challenges and responsibility
are accurate and reliable
work well under pressure
communicate well
set high standards for yourself
