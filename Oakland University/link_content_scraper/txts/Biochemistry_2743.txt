Biochemistry Major: The Oakland University Advantage
With medical and nursing schools on campus and an active Center for Biomedical Research, our biochemistry degree offers the breadth and depth you need to develop first-rate skills. We also have a tight-knit program that ensures every biochemistry major gets extensive one-on-one attention from research-active faculty and from an academic adviser. You’ll work in an apprentice-style setting that cultivates proficiency in research design, scientific writing, and biomedical inquiry rather than just lab techniques.
Oakland’s biochemistry degree also excels for its:
Extensive research training.
Students in our biochemistry program typically spend 10 to 20 hours per week in the lab during the semester, with opportunities to gain additional experience and spend even more time in the lab through our Summer Undergraduate Research Program. You can start participating in research as early as your freshman year, developing skills that biochemistry majors usually don’t acquire until graduate school.
High-caliber facilities.
As a tier 2 research university, Oakland maintains professional labs with advanced instrumentation such as electron microscopes and mass spectrometers. Our biochemistry program enables you to work with research technology involved in cell physiology, gene regulation, environmental science, molecular biology, and other subdisciplines.
Distinguished faculty.
At Oakland you’ll take every biochemistry course and laboratory from Ph.D. faculty, rather than graduate students. You’ll train with active researchers who go far beyond classroom instruction, acting as career mentors and professional guides.
Diverse areas of inquiry.
You can pursue a wide range of research interests in our biochemistry degree. Current investigations focus on niches such as heart disease, neurodegenerative disorders, DNA repair mechanisms, cancer prevention, cell microstructures and medicinal-related chemistry. Our Center for Biomedical Research fosters collaboration between academic departments and with off-campus partners in the healthcare, pharmaceutical and medical technology industries.
Strong outcomes.
Graduates of Oakland’s biochemistry degree have an outstanding record of postgraduate success. Our biochemistry majors achieve strong MCAT scores and excellent admission rates to medical, dental, and biochemistry Ph.D. programs.
What Can You Do With a Biochemistry Degree?
Biochemistry majors at Oakland University get exceptional training for careers in biomedical research, medical practice, and health sciences. You’ll receive excellent preparation for preadmission exams such as the MCAT and GRE, with outstanding opportunities to move on to:
Graduate degree programs in biochemistry or related fields
Medical school
Dental school
Military research programs
Pharmaceuticals
