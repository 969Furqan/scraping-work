Requirements for English, B.A. to M.A. degree
The English B.A. to M.A. program allows students to make accelerated progress toward the English M.A. by completing coursework for the English B.A. and M.A. degrees simultaneously and counting up to three M.A. courses toward the B.A. while paying undergraduate tuition rates for those courses.
Admission to the B.A. to M.A. accelerated program is granted only by the Department of English.
To be eligible for the English B.A. to M.A. program, students must:
Have completed at least 20 credits toward the English major, including
ENG 2100 - Introduction to Literary Studies
and at least two courses at the 3000 level
Have an overall GPA of at least 3.0 and an in-major GPA of at least 3.5.
Apply for and receive delayed admission into the program
Upon completion of all B.A. degree requirements, students with deferred admission into the graduate M.A. program who have maintained an overall undergraduate GPA of 3.00 and earned a minimum 3.0 grade in each of their graduate courses will be formally admitted to the M.A. program. The 12 credits to be double-counted will be designated as applicable to the graduate degree after the student receives the B.A. degree and is formally accepted into the graduate program. This designation will be canceled if the student is denied formal admission or withdraws from the graduate program.
Students who receive approval to enter the program will substitute three of the following graduate-level courses for three 3000-level ENG courses that count toward the English B.A.
ENG 5810 Literary History: British Medieval (4)
ENG 5811 Literary History: British Early Modern (4)
ENG 5812 Literary History: Restoration & Eighteenth-Century (4)
ENG 5813 Literary History: British Romanticism (4)
ENG 5814 Literary History: Victorian (4)
ENG 5815 Literary History: British Since 1900 (4)
ENG 5816 Literary History: Postcolonial (4)
ENG 5820 Literary History: Early American (4)
ENG 5821 Literary History: American Nineteenth-Century (4)
ENG 5822 Literary History: American Twentieth-Century (4)
ENG 5823 Literary History: American Post-WWII (4)
ENG 5900 Advanced Topics in Literature and Language (2Â­-4)
ENG 5904 Literary Kinds: Fiction (4)
ENG 5905 Literary Kinds: Drama (4)
ENG 5906 Literary Kinds: Poetry (4)
ENG 5907 Literary Kinds: Modes or Special Forms (4)
Students in the combined program will not take English 5200 (Introduction to Graduate Studies) and English 5330 (Critical Theory/Practice) until after they have been admitted to the M.A.; for these students only, 5200 and 5330 will be considered co-requisites for 6000-level coursework.
Students who apply for and then opt out of the combined program may still count any 5000-level M.A. classes they have completed successfully toward the B.A. as 3000-level electives.
To apply to the accelerated English B.A. to M.A. program, contact Professor Joanne Lipson Freed, English M.A. Program Director, at (248) 370-2255 or
freed@oakland.edu

Students using this catalog to meet English major requirements may also use any course subsequently approved as satisfying requirements in any of the literature categories and published in a later catalog.
