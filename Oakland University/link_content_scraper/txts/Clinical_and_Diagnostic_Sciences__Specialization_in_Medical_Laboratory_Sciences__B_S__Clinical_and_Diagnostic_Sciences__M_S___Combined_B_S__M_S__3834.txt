This combined bachelor/master degree program provides high-achieving students an opportunity to complete a bachelor’s and master’s degree in less time than would be required if the two degrees were done independently. Participants can graduate with a Master of Science in Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences in approximately one calendar year after completing a B.S. in Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences with a specialization in Medical Laboratory Science. Students in this program complete 12 graduate level credits at undergraduate tuition rates. Students who have earned a 3.0 or above GPA in each of the 12-credits of graduate courses will be reclassified as a graduate student through Graduate Study.
Requirements for the Combined B.S./M.S. Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences (CDS), Specialization in Medical Laboratory Sciences Degree Program
Students seeking the Combined B.S./M.S. degree plan must complete a minimum of 120, including the following requirements:
1. Meet the university general education requirements
In order to graduate on-schedule without taking additional courses, it is highly recommended that students meet with an Undergraduate Academic Adviser concerning the selection of all of their general education courses.
Each candidate for an Oakland University baccalaureate will need to satisfactorily complete approved courses in each of the following areas: Foundation, Exploration, Integration, Writing, U.S. Diversity and Capstone. For details, refer to the

A student accepted into the program continues his or her undergraduate degree with the substitution of four graduate courses as shown above.
Please note that students must be accepted into the program before taking any graduate level courses. If a student in the program has successfully graduated with a BS degree, he or she and is fully admitted to the graduate MLS program.
