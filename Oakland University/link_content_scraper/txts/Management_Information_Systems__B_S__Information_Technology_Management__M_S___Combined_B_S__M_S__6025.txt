The Management Information Systems, B.S./Information Technology Management, M.S., is a combined bachelor/master degree program that provides high-achieving students an opportunity to complete a bachelor’s and master’s degree in less time than would be required if the two degrees were done independently.  It is designed for students who are high academic achievers and creates an integrated learning experience along several knowledge paths.  The MSITM, Combined B.S./M.S. program students will be able to earn their master’s degree by completing 18 credits (6 courses instead of 10) beyond the undergraduate MIS major requirements.
Students accepted for the MSITM, Combined B.S./M.S. program must have a minimum overall undergraduate GPA of 3.2.  Students may apply to the MSITM, Combined B.S./M.S. program and be offered deferred admission to the graduate program during their junior year. MSITM, Combined B.S./M.S. applicants may request to waive the GMAT requirement.  To be eligible for the waiver, applicants must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher.  To request a waiver, download, complete, and submit the Request to Waive GMAT Form.  This form is found under Supplemental Application, School of Business Administration.
It is important that students register for the 5000-level classes that are double counted in order to satisfy the electives requirement for the MIS major as well as get credit towards the MSITM program. If students take only the 4000-level electives, those courses cannot be counted for the MSITM degree.
Students offered deferred admission will remain classified as undergraduates until they have completed all undergraduate degree requirements.  At that time, students who have maintained an overall undergraduate GPA 3.2 and have earned a 3.0 or above GPA in the double-counted graduate courses, will be reclassified as a graduate student through Graduate Study.
Please refer to the Graduate Catalog for the recommended Schedule and Course Options for the MSITM, Combined B.S./M.S. program.
Specific offerings for each semester may be found in the
