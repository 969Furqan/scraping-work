The combined Bachelor of Science in Engineering and Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering program (Combined B.S.E./M.S.) option is designed for highly motivated and qualified students pursuing a Bachelor of Science of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering at Oakland University and wishing to complete a Master of Science of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering directly following the completion of their undergraduate degree requirements.
This program allows students to replace their undergraduate professional elective courses with the following graduate-level courses:
One of following theory courses: APM 5441 or ME 5400,
Master’s Thesis Research: ME 6998 (4 credits), and
A 5000-level or above ME course of the student’s choosing, which meets both the M.S. and B.S.E. requirements as described in their respective catalogs:
Mechanical Engineering, B.S.E.
and
Mechanical Engineering, M.S.
The above graduate-level courses will count toward both the B.S.E. and the M.S. degree. A critical component of this program is the completion of graduate-level research. This research work begins in the last year of the student’s undergraduate studies and culminates in a Master’s Thesis.
Specific offerings for each semester may be found in the
Schedule of Classes
.
To be eligible for the Mechanical Engineering, Combined B.S.E./M.S. option, students must:
Have an overall GPA of 3.5 or higher.
Apply for and receive delayed admission into the M.S. program after reaching junior standing (90 credit hours or more).
Complete the three graduate-level Mechanical Engineering courses with a grade of B or better.
Complete a Master’s Thesis under the supervision of a Mechanical Engineering Faculty member at Oakland University.
* Students admitted to this accelerated program can graduate with an M.S. degree in five years.
To apply:
To apply to the Combined B.S.E/M.S. in Mechanical Engineering Program, select the “Combined B.S.E./M.S. program” option in the application for the Mechanical Engineering M.S. degree. Indicate a thesis advisor or a research interest area on the application and upload your approved plan of study, which has been developed with your both your thesis and academic advisor. After admission to the program has been granted, automatic override to take 5000-level classes will be given.
