We provide one-on-one attention to help you progress toward your biology career goals and maximize the value of your biology degree.
As a biology major at Oakland University, you’ll benefit from:
Outstanding pre-med preparation.
You can get an extraordinary head start on medical school in Oakland University’s human cadaver lab, one of the few U.S. facilities of this type for undergraduate biology majors. In addition, our biology degree leverages partnerships with local hospitals and clinics to provide students with first-hand experience in professional settings.
Elite research opportunities.
Most biology majors at Oakland University work directly with senior faculty on research, performing graduate-level work that gets noticed on resumes and grad-school applications. We have two biological preserves on campus, a biomedical research center, and active investigations in a wide array of subjects.
Real-world experience.
In addition to conducting research, you can acquire biology job skills through internships, volunteer activities, and other special opportunities our biology degree offers. You might learn to conduct DNA analysis, design bioinformatics inquiries, work with animals at the Detroit Zoo, write up drug-trial results, assist in veterinary surgery, or gain other professional skills.
Exceptional instructors.
Our biology degree is taught by a diverse faculty that represents every branch of biology and a wide range of biology careers. You’ll learn from active researchers and professional practitioners who combine academic expertise with practical know-how.
Well-rounded academics.
Most careers in biology (including medicine) require more than scientific knowledge. Our biology degree equips you with skills that matter to medical schools, other graduate programs, and employers seeking to fill biology jobs. You’ll gain proficiency in writing, communication, and interdisciplinary collaboration, along with the ability to work on teams
