Admission review and assessment

Applicants with an undergraduate GPA less than 3.0, but with an appropriate academic background and strong letters of recommendation, may be considered for admission in limited standing. Students who qualify for this admission classification must complete a maximum of 12 credits of graduate coursework with a grade of 3.0 or above in each course within the first three academic terms from the time of initial enrollment.

Satisfactory academic progress
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is the term
used to denote a student’s successful completion of coursework toward a certificate or degree. Federal regulations require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor Satisfactory Academic Progress for all financial aid recipients each semester.
Students who fall behind in their coursework, or fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and completion of classes, may lose their eligibility for all types of federal, state and university aid. Contact the
Office of Financial Aid
for additional details.
Good academic standing
All graduate students are expected to remain in
good academic standing
throughout
the entire course of their graduate program. To be in good academic standing, a graduate student must make satisfactory progress toward fulfilling degree requirements, including the completion of critical degree milestones as set forth by the academic program.
The student must also maintain a minimum semester and overall GPA of 3.0 (B).
Good academic standing is a requirement for:
Holding a Graduate Assistantship
Receiving a fellowship or scholarship
Advancing to candidacy for a graduate degree
Going on a leave of absence
Obtaining a graduate certificate or degree from Oakland University.
Additionally, graduate students must meet all department academic standards which may be more stringent than the minimum set forth by the University.
Graduate students who are not in good academic standing for any reason are subject to probation and/or dismissal from further graduate study.

Plan of study
All accepted applicants, in consultation with their assigned faculty program adviser, must develop a plan of study that details specific courses the students will use to satisfy their degree requirements. The plan of study must be approved by the faculty program adviser and submitted by the student to the Oakland University Graduate School Office.
Master’s and graduate certificate students must submit a department-approved plan of study by the end of their first semester of graduate coursework. Doctoral students must submit an approved plan of study prior to completion of the first year of coursework. (See the
Graduate Student Responsibility
section of this catalog.)
Note:  Credit granted for successful completion of a course toward an undergraduate degree program may not be repeated for a graduate degree. If a substitution is approved, the minimum number of program-approved graduate credits will be required. A
Petition of Exception - OU Course Waiver/ Substitution
requesting the substitution must be approved.

Relationship to the Master of Education in Special Education
Requirements for the certificate and endorsement programs are contained within the degree programs. Courses taken in an endorsement or certificate program may apply to the M.Ed. if the courses are transferred to the M.Ed. program before completion of the endorsement/certificate program (i.e., requirement is students have a three-year time frame for completion of the certificate program) and if courses are taken within the six-year time frame allowed for the degree.
