Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies: What to Expect
Our Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (BIS) program is designed to provide you with a comprehensive and well-informed educational experience. Working closely with your BIS adviser, you’ll follow a structured process to ensure you’re on the right path:
Plan of Study:
This document outlines your selected coursework for your interdisciplinary studies degree, tailored to your unique goals. You have the flexibility to incorporate one or more minors and explore course options while considering prerequisites. Adviser consultations are essential to align your academic journey with your goals.
Rationale:
The interdisciplinary studies rationale enables you to reflect on your academic aspirations and choose coursework that aligns with your career objectives. You’ll respond to six questions outlining how your selected courses will help you achieve your goals. The adviser reviews the rationale and plan of study before submission to the faculty council for approval.
Faculty Mentor:
Meeting with a faculty mentor offers the opportunity to discuss your education and career goals with an expert in your chosen field. You’ll gain valuable insights to solidify your interdisciplinary studies coursework choices and inquire about your career path and potential opportunities. The faculty mentor is selected by the adviser once your plan of study and rationale are approved. After this meeting, both you and your faculty mentor sign the application for acceptance into the BIS program.
