Journalism Degree: The Oakland University Advantage
Oakland University offers ideal conditions to prepare for journalism as a career. Southeast Michigan is a major media market with news organizations of every type and robust opportunities to cover stories in business, technology, politics, sports, and other subjects.
Our journalism degree excels for its:
Exceptional real-world opportunities.
Our journalism degree requires a professional internship, but students routinely do more than one. Media organizations actively recruit our journalism majors because they have the skills and confidence to make real contributions. You’ll gain meaningful experience that helps you start your career in journalism with a competitive edge.
Emphasis on professionalism.
Our journalism degree integrates classroom instruction with hands-on learning. Courses emphasize project-based assignments and case studies that enable you to put textbook concepts into practice. Another significant benefit of Oakland’s degree in journalism: You can start working in student-run media as a freshman, rather than waiting until your junior or senior year.
Outstanding on-campus media facilities.
Many journalism majors work for the student-run Oakland Post, an independent weekly newspaper that publishes daily digital updates. You can also work for Oakland’s award-winning campus radio station, produce video news segments for OUTV, and collaborate independently with student and faculty organizations to publicize events, achievements, and fundraisers.
Personalized instruction.
Most of our journalism classes have 19 students or fewer, so you’ll benefit from one-on-one attention from instructors. Our journalism degree is led by diverse international faculty, most of whom are media veterans who’ve succeeded in journalism as a career.
Career connections.
Oakland’s journalism department has a high profile in Southeast Michigan and maintains ongoing partnerships with news organizations, PR firms, and other media companies. We regularly host career fairs, resume workshops, and networking events that allow you to meet potential employers and get your name out there.
