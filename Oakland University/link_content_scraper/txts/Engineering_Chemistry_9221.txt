Engineering Chemistry
The Bachelor of Science in engineering chemistry is intended for well-qualified students who seek a basic preparation in engineering along with a highly professional chemistry program. This program is offered in cooperation with the School of Engineering and Computer Science.
Engineering chemists work with raw materials to produce valuable products, including pharmaceuticals and “green” fuels. They also find ways to better clean up toxic spills or make food production safer. Engineering chemists different from all other engineers because they bring forward chemical solutions to engineering problems. Their expertise is most often applied to environmental development, in the design of processes and in the design of electronic and structural materials.
