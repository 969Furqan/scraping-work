Department Website
This combined bachelor/master degree program provides high-achieving students an opportunity to complete a bachelor’s and master’s degree in less time than would be required if the two degrees were done independently. Participants can graduate with an M.S. in Exercise Science in approximately one calendar year after completing a B.S. in Exercise Science. Students in the program complete 12 graduate level credits at the undergraduate tuition rates. Students who have a minimum overall undergraduate GPA of 3.2 and have earned a 3.0 or above GPA in each of the 12-credits of graduate courses will be reclassified as a graduate student through the Graduate School.
Specific offerings for each semester may be found in the
Schedule of Classes
.
Requirements for the Combined B.S./M.S. in Exercise Science (EXS) Degree Program
If a student has a minimum overall GPA of 3.2, has at least junior standing, and has completed half of the department credits required for the major the student may apply to the B.S./M.S. in EXS program through the graduate school. Qualified applicants will be given a delayed admission to the EXS program. (Full, formal admission will not take place until the student successfully completes his or her undergraduate degree).
A student accepted into the combined B.S./M.S. in EXS program continues his or her undergraduate degree with the substitution of 4 graduate courses.
If a combined B.S./M.S. program student has successfully graduated with a B.S. degree and an overall GPA of 3.0, he or she is fully admitted to the M.S. in EXS program.
*See graduate catalog for additional requirements for the combined B.S./M.S. program.
Students seeking the Combined B.S./M.S. in EXS program must complete a minimum of 123 credits to earn the B.S. and an additional 20 graduate credits to earn the M.S. See requirements below:
1. General Education Requirements
In order to graduate on-schedule without taking additional courses, it is highly recommended that students meet with an Undergraduate Academic Adviser concerning the selection of all of their general education courses.
Each candidate for an Oakland University baccalaureate will need to satisfactorily complete approved courses in each of the following areas: Foundation, Exploration, Integration, Writing, U.S. Diversity and Capstone. For details, refer to the
General Education
section of the catalog.
