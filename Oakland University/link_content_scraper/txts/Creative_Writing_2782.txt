Creative Writing Degree: The Oakland University Advantage
Oakland University’s bachelor’s degree in creative writing with a focus on fiction is designed as an introduction to writing across genres and formats. In today’s multimedia environment, being a writer who is as comfortable writing a novel as crafting a compelling screenplay can expand your imagination and help you stand out from others.
There are so many features that help make our Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing program highly respected
A few of the benefits you can enjoy as a creative writing major at OU include:
Collaborative-driven program:
What is creative writing without readers? In our creative writing degree program, you’ll learn to share your work with your peers to receive and accept feedback, as well as how to provide others with thoughtful and constructive criticism. You will also learn from
award-winning faculty
who will prepare you to become a professional writer.
Internship opportunities:
We offer creative writing and English majors
internships
that give you practical experience working alongside professionals. You’ll plan your creative writing degree internship with the Internship Coordinator to craft the perfect path to reach your goals.
Alumni mentoring:
Make the transition from creative writing major to professional as seamless as possible by participating in our
English Alumni Mentoring Program
. In your junior or senior year, you’ll be paired with an alum of the creative writing degree program to learn from their experience and possibly visit their workplace to see first-hand what you can do with a creative writing degree.
A focus on literary history:
With an emphasis on literary history, we introduce you to the rich history of your genre so you can build a Janus-like appreciation for the writers that came before you while creating your own works of art that push your genre forward.
What Can You Do With a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing?
Earning a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing can make you an impressive candidate for a broad range of careers in fiction, screenwriting, playwriting, television, editing, teaching and journalism.
If you decide to pursue a career in private sector industries such as technology or business, your skills as a writer and storyteller will be essential to helping you stand out from other job candidates who lack the ability to draw readers’ attention with compelling and error-free prose.
Do you dream of becoming a teacher and sharing your expertise with others? Maybe you would like to dedicate your career to the study of literature and creative writing? Or perhaps you want to be on the fast-track to executive roles? Earning a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing can give you a strong foundation to continue your education in a graduate program and enhance your professional and storytelling skills.
As you progress through the Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing program, you can take advantage of our
Career and Life Design Center
. Meet with a coach to design the life you want and prepare for your dream career in creative writing or a related field.
