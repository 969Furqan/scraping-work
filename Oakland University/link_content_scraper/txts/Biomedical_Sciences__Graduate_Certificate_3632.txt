Graduate Application Requirements
Additional department application requirements
Applicants should have earned a bachelor’s degree in biology or related subject (e.g., biomedical sciences, health sciences, biochemistry, molecular biology, botany, or zoology) from a regionally accredited institution or proof of a U.S. equivalent degree for internationally educated applicants.
Applicants with an earned bachelor’s degree in another discipline must have completed 5 lecture courses in biology, 2 lecture courses in college-level mathematics, 1 lecture course in physics, and 3 lecture courses in chemistry. Applicants with undergraduate prerequisite course deficiencies in these areas must complete the preparatory coursework before being admitted to the program.

Satisfactory academic progress
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is the term used to denote a student’s successful completion of coursework toward a certificate or degree. Federal regulations require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor Satisfactory Academic Progress for all financial aid recipients each semester.
Students who fall behind in their coursework, or fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and completion of classes, may lose their eligibility for all types of federal, state and university aid. Contact the
Office of Financial Aid
for additional details.
Good academic standing
All graduate students are expected to remain in
good academic standing
throughout
the entire course of their graduate program. To be in good academic standing, a graduate student must make satisfactory progress toward fulfilling degree requirements, including the completion of critical degree milestones as set forth by the academic program. The student must also maintain a minimum semester and overall GPA of 3.0
(B) or better
.
Good academic standing is a requirement for:

Additionally, graduate students must meet all department academic standards which may be more stringent than the minimum set forth by the University.

Plan of study
All accepted applicants, in consultation with their assigned faculty program adviser, must develop a plan of study that details specific courses the students will use to satisfy their degree requirements.

Petition of Exception - OU Course Waiver/ Substitution
requesting the substitution must be approved.
