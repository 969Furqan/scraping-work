MPH Degree: The Oakland University Advantage
Our extensive partnerships in Southeast Michigan create unique opportunities for students in our MPH degree. You’ll interact with and learn from a wide range of public health stakeholders, acquiring an exceptionally broad perspective that equips you for all kinds of public health careers. Oakland University’s medical school adds further value to our MPH program, providing you with access to medical experts, data, clinics, and research opportunities.
In addition, our MPH degree stands out for its strengths in:
Diversity and social justice.
Our MPH program allows you to work with people of all types, including low-income families, immigrants, people of color, children, and other populations who lack equal access to health care. You’ll have opportunities to help organize, educate, and empower these communities, acquiring skills that many MPH degrees neglect.
Applied research.
We require 16 credits of research-oriented coursework in our MPH degree, including a capstone project consisting of supervised, self-directed research. Many MPH students exceed these requirements and engage in extracurricular research, working independently or in collaboration with faculty and/or public health professionals off campus.
Results-oriented expertise.
You’ll acquire practical tools in our MPH program, using an evidence-based approach that helps you solve problems and maximize health benefits. By the time you complete the MPH degree, you’ll know how to assess community capacities, identify needs, evaluate programs, measure outcomes, and design new solutions.
Faculty engagement.
Instructors in our MPH program are immersed in the community as researchers, consultants, and collaborators. Their connections can help you get involved in research projects, service-learning activities, professional internships, and other opportunities that can put your public health career on the fast track.
Rigorous academics.
Oakland University’s master in public health degree is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH). You’ll earn a highly interdisciplinary MPH that integrates concepts from the health sciences, public administration, environmental health, mental health, statistics, education, nursing, exercise science, and other fields.
