Sonographers must integrate complex knowledge and advanced technical skills in the imaging of internal structures and they must apply knowledge of advanced anatomy and physiology in the performance of their duties. Individuals interested in this career must be able to communicate effectively with patients and other health-care professionals. The sonographer must display compassion, competence and concern in order to meet the special needs of the patient. Direct patient contact is required while performing this job.
Admission to clinical specialization internship
To be accepted into a diagnostic medical sonography (DMS) affiliate program, students must submit a formal application for each program for which they seek consideration.

In addition to submitting a formal application, students may also be required to interview, acquire and maintain CPR certification for Health Care Providers, job shadow in sonography, obtain clinical medical experience, and/or take an admissions exam. Students must have a minimum of a 2.8 overall GPA to be considered for acceptance, however it is recommended that students have at least a 3.0 overall GPA.
Acceptance into a DMS program is competitive and not guaranteed. Acceptance is determined by each DMS program affiliate and is based on prerequisite course-work GPA, specific course grades, interview, previous work experience, letters of recommendation, and documentation of required patient care and shadowing experience. Students who are accepted to an accredited DMS program will receive all academic and clinical education from instructors employed by that program. Grades while attending the DMS hospital will be reported to Oakland for their OU transcript pass/fail, however letter grades will be utilized on the program transcript. Students should check the clinical affiliate program’s websites for exact application dates, prerequisite requirements, and grade requirements.

In order to protect patients and provide a safe environment for students, staff, and the public, all students are required to have up-to-date immunizations, including the seasonal flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine. If an applicant fails to comply with the immunization policy, fails the mandatory health screen and/or background check, the applicant’s acceptance into the program will be rescinded.
