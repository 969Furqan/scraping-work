Program description
The Master of Science in Interdisciplinary Healthcare Systems degree program will train current and future healthcare professionals to work effectively in interprofessional healthcare teams that focus on patient-centered care, consider needs of vulnerable populations, use information in quality improvement endeavors, and apply principles of evidence-based practice.
This is a two-year, 32-34 credit degree program with three possible tracks: A) Professional track designed for students currently working in or planning for non-clinical employment within healthcare systems, B) Dietetic track for students planning to complete Beaumont Hospital’s Dietetic Internship with career goals as a registered dietitian, and C) Research track for students intending on careers in research or intending to obtain a PhD. Students will take one year of courses prior to starting a practicum/internship or developing and completing a research project, which they will complete in their second year. In their capstone course, students will disseminate their projects and findings using a variety of techniques, including formal presentations to stakeholders.
