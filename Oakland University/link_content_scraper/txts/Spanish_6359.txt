Spanish
Spanish is spoken by more than 559 million people globally. In the United States, over 13% of the population speaks Spanish at home which makes the US the second largest population of Spanish speakers in the world after Mexico. Learning Spanish is key for business, politics, and for contributing to your education as a global citizen.
We study the process of second language acquisition, explore the cultural history of the Spanish world, and gain fluency in technical Spanish for the professions.
