The Public Health, Combined B.S./M.P.H. is a combined bachelor/master degree program that provides high-achieving students an opportunity to complete a bachelor’s and master’s degree in less time than would be required if the two degrees were done independently. Participants can graduate with a Master of Public Health degree in approximately one calendar year after completing a B.S. in Public Health. Students in this program complete 12 graduate level credits at undergraduate tuition rates. Students who have a minimum overall undergraduate GPA of 3.2 and have earned a 3.0 or above GPA in each of the 12-credits of graduate courses will be reclassified as a graduate student through Graduate Study.
Specific offerings for each semester may be found in the
Schedule of Classes
