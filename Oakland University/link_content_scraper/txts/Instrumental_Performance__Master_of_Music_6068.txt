Oral examination
Culminating project
For candidates for a Master of Music in instrumental performance, the culminating project is a master’s recital.
Students are urged to plan ahead for the recital. Obtain information about the expectations from your adviser early in the degree program.
Oral examination
After completion of the recital, the student will be asked to make a 10- to 15-minute presentation to his or her recital committee. This might include discussion of interpretation, editions chosen, historical aspects of the works chosen, and so on.
A satisfactory presentation of material reflective of a satisfactory recital constitutes passing the Oral Examination for the degree of Master of Music. Any student who does not pass this examination may be offered the examination again one semester later, upon the approval of the student’s adviser.
Satisfactory academic progress
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is the term used to denote a student’s successful completion of coursework toward a certificate or degree. Federal regulations require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor Satisfactory Academic Progress for all financial aid recipients each semester.
Students who fall behind in their coursework, or fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and completion of classes, may lose their eligibility for all types of federal, state and university aid. Contact the
Office of Financial Aid
for additional details.
Good academic standing
All graduate students are expected to remain in
good academic standing
throughout
the entire course of their graduate program. To be in good academic standing, a graduate student must make satisfactory progress toward fulfilling degree requirements, including the completion of critical degree milestones as set forth by the academic program. The student must also maintain a minimum semester and overall GPA of 3.0.
Good academic standing is a requirement for:
Holding a Graduate Assistantship
Receiving a fellowship or scholarship
Advancing to candidacy for a graduate degree
Going on a leave of absence
Obtaining a graduate certificate or degree from Oakland University.
Additionally, graduate students must meet all department academic standards which may be more stringent than the minimum set forth by the University.
Department requirements
:  Because of the nature of graduate education, a high standard of work is expected.
A minimum grade of B is required in all courses.
Any student earning a grade below B will be placed on probationary status through a letter from the department indicating that earning a second grade below B in any course will result in dismissal from the program.
In any course where a student earns a final grade lower than B, the student must seek approval to repeat the course by submitting a
Petition to Repeat a Course
form OR seek approval to substitute a different course, appropriate to the degree requirements, by submitting a
Petition for Course Waiver/Substitution
.
Graduate students who are not in good academic standing for any reason are subject to probation and/or dismissal from further graduate study.

Plan of study
All accepted applicants, in consultation with their assigned faculty program adviser, must develop a plan of study that details specific courses the students will use to satisfy their degree requirements. The plan of study must be approved by the faculty program adviser and submitted by the student to Oakland University Graduate School.
Master’s and graduate certificate students must submit a department-approved plan of study by the end of their first semester of graduate coursework. Doctoral students must submit an approved plan of study prior to completion of the first year of coursework. (See the
Graduate Student Responsibility
section of this catalog.)
Note:  Credit granted for successful completion of a course toward an undergraduate degree program may not be repeated for a graduate degree. If a substitution is approved, the minimum number of program-approved graduate credits will be required. A
Petition of Exception - OU Course Waiver/ Substitution
requesting the substitution must be approved.
