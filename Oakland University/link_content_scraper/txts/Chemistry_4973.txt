Chemistry Degree: The Oakland University Advantage
Located in the heart of a world-class manufacturing hub, Oakland University provides chemistry majors with one-of-a-kind opportunities. You’ll earn your chemistry degree in close proximity to global leaders in energy, automotive, health care and other industries, enabling you to connect with experts and innovators in the community and on campus. In addition, the world’s two largest chemical companies (Dow and BASF) both have major R&D facilities in Michigan.
Oakland’s
chemistry degree
enables you to:
Acquire advanced research training.
Our
chemistry majors
routinely work with senior faculty on cutting-edge studies, participating at a level that’s typically reserved for graduate students. You can acquire intensive, hands-on instruction in everything from lab practices and data analysis to writing, publishing and presentation. All of our chemistry majors have the opportunity to co-author research publications and present their work at national and international scientific conferences.
Stand out in the graduate-school applicant pool.
Oakland’s
degree in chemistry
has gained a reputation for producing strong master’s and Ph.D. candidates. Our chemistry majors are consistently recognized with awards from the American Chemical Society at the local and national levels. A number of our recent
chemistry majors
have gained admission to top-ranked graduate
chemistry programs
such as Northwestern, Illinois, UCLA, Michigan, Duke, Purdue and Michigan State.
Get extensive faculty attention.
Our
degree in chemistry
features small classes taught by Ph.D faculty, not graduate students. You’ll enjoy direct, one-on-one interaction, in the classroom and research laboratory, with dynamic professors who publish and present widely, have extensive professional networks, and devote their full attention to undergraduate
chemistry majors
.
Work in high-caliber facilities.
Our
chemistry labs
include the same equipment that’s used in industry, giving you a head start on your
career in chemistry
. You’ll have the chance to work with advanced, professional-grade spectrometers, dry boxes, solvent purification technology, and biochemistry instrumentation such as confocal fluorescence microscopes, flow cytometers and ultracentrifuges.
Acquire first-rate teacher training.
Because Oakland University ranks as one of Michigan’s top sources of middle- and high-school science teachers, some
chemistry majors
opt for our fifth-year Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP). With one additional year, you can combine your
chemistry degree
with robust educator training that qualifies you for a teaching license. Science teachers are in high demand and command good salaries.
What Can You Do With a Chemistry Degree?
You can compete for a broad range of
jobs with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry
. Oakland graduates enter the workforce with excellent qualifications, and Southeast Michigan offers boundless opportunities to pursue
careers in chemistry
. Dow and BASF (the world’s two largest chemical companies) both operate major facilities in Michigan, and you can also find jobs in industries such as:
Manufacturing
Energy
Pharmaceutical
Health care
Automotive
Food processing
Defense
About half of Oakland’s
chemistry majors
pursue advanced
degrees in chemistry
, attend medical or dental school, or enter other graduate programs. Our students have a strong record of postgraduate achievement that includes admission to top-rated graduate
chemistry programs
and prestigious fellowships from the National Institutes of Health.
Chemistry Major: What You’ll Learn
Our
Bachelor of Science in Chemistry
is accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS). The degree includes a rigorous academic core of 10
chemistry courses
with associated labs, including:
General Chemistry I and II
Organic Chemistry I and II
Computational Chemistry
Physical Chemistry I and II
Analytical Chemistry
Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry
Biochemistry
In addition, the chemistry degree requires eight credits of electives (including a minimum of two lab credits), two courses in calculus and two courses in physics. It is recommended (but not required) that chemistry majors also take courses in biology, calculus and statistics.
