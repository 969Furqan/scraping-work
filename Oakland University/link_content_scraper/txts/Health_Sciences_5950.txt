Bachelor’s in Health Sciences Degree: The Oakland University Advantage
Our health sciences program combines the resources of a major research university with the intimacy of a much smaller school. You’ll attend small classes and get one-on-one guidance from faculty, earning an intensive, personalized health sciences degree that promotes your success. Undergraduate health sciences research and clinical opportunities further enhance your study of health science, providing valuable real-world experience.
In Oakland University’s health sciences degree program, you can:
Master essential knowledge.
Build a rigorous and flexible academic foundation by adapting your health sciences degree to fit your needs. Our health sciences program promotes a broad perspective and versatile skills essential in health science careers that routinely involve collaboration among multiple specialists.
Learn from the best.
Most Oakland University health science courses are taught by senior faculty, not adjuncts or graduate students. Your professors will know you by name, understand your interests and strengths, and connect you with opportunities and resources that help you achieve your goals.
Choose your specialty.
In addition to a comprehensive STEM, liberal arts and social science core, you can focus your study of health science by choosing one of three health science tracks: pre-health professional studies, holistic health or pre-pharmacy.
Shape a better future.
