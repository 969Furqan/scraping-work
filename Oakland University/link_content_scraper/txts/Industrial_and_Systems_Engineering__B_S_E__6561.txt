Industrial and Systems Engineering: The Oakland University Advantage
Between our deep industry connections and our high-achieving graduates, Oakland University has earned a reputation as a prime source of industrial and systems engineering talent. Employers routinely start recruiting our industrial and systems engineering majors before graduation.
Our industrial and systems engineering degree helps you stand out in the job market because it offers:
Unique professional opportunities.
With one-of-a-kind partnerships in high-profile industries, our industrial and systems engineering degree offers extraordinary opportunities for internships and other workplace experience. You’ll strengthen your resume, acquire advanced training, and develop professional polish that makes a huge impression on potential employers.
Practical, results-oriented instruction.
Our industrial and systems engineering degree takes you way beyond textbook theory. You’ll get an applied education that emphasizes hands-on projects in real-world settings, using the same Industry 4.0 processes and technologies as professional industrial and systems engineers.
Stellar facilities.
You’ll take most industrial and systems engineering courses in Oakland University’s state-of-the-art Engineering Center, which opened in 2014. You can also get involved in industry-sponsored engineering projects at campus facilities such as the Sharf Computer-Integrated Manufacturing Lab, Product Lifecycle Management Lab, Ergonomics and Human Performance Lab, and the Pawley Lean Institute.
Exceptional faculty.
Our industrial and systems engineering degree is led by authorities in industrial and systems engineering. Some have years of prior industry experience, and most are actively involved as consultants or research partners with industry.
Personalized support.
Although we’re large enough to boast top-notch facilities, Oakland University features small industrial and systems engineering classes that ensure lots of student-faculty interaction. You’ll develop one-on-one relationships with mentors who support your academic success and offer strong guidance for your engineering career.
