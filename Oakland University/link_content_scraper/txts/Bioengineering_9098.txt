Bioengineering: The Oakland University Advantage
Oakland University is located in the midst of a major biomedical engineering industry hub. National leaders in health care, computing, electronics, biomedicine, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and other bioengineering sectors have operations in Southeast Michigan, creating opportunities you can’t find in most bioengineering degree programs.
Our bioengineering degree enables you to:
Make professional connections.
Heavyweight players in the bioengineering industry regularly seek Oakland University’s collaboration on scientific and technical research. Those relationships create unique opportunities for you to interact with biomedical engineering pros, gain hands-on experience, connect with potential employers, and get a head start on the biomedical engineering job market.
Conduct undergraduate research.
Two on-campus facilities—the Center for Biomedical Research, and the Institute for Stem Cell and Regnerative Medicine—are active in bioengineering research. You’ll have opportunities to collaborate with senior faculty, getting experience that helps you stand out in the job market.
Acquire specialized skills.
Oakland University’s bioengineering degree includes five professional tracks that deepen your expertise in specific branches of biomedical engineering. You can choose among bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, computational biology, electronic devices and biosensors, and molecular engineering biology.
Learn from superior faculty.
Our bioengineering professors combine high academic distinction with extensive industry connections and experience. Small class sizes ensure that you get plenty of faculty face time, building strong personal relationships with your instructors.
Showcase your ability.
The bioengineering degree program concludes with an independent research or capstone project. You’ll identify the challenge, design the solution, run the experiments, and publish the data or build the prototype.
What can you do with a Bioengineering Degree?
Biomedical Engineering Careers
Rapid industry growth has produced an abundance of bioengineering job opportunities and extremely high demand for bioengineering expertise. Biomedical engineer salaries are correspondingly high. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average U.S. bioengineering salary is nearly $100,000.
Our bioengineering degree prepares you for a wide range of career options, including opportunities in subspecialties such as:
Bioinstrumentation
Biomaterials
Medical imaging
Tissue engineering
Genetic engineering
Bioinformatics
Orthopedics
Prosthetics
Pharmaceuticals
Bioengineering Degree: What You'll Study
Offered jointly the the School of Engineering and Computer Science and Oakland University’s biology department, the bioengineering degree combines training in biology with depth in computation and/or engineering. A sampling of required courses includes:
Calculus
Biology
Human Physiology
Physics
Organic Chemistry
Engineering graphics and AutoCAD
Engineering biology
