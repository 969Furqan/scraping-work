Each candidate for an Oakland University baccalaureate will need to satisfactorily complete approved courses in each of the following areas: Foundation, Exploration, Integration, Writing, U.S. Diversity and Capstone. For details, refer to the
General Education Requirements
section of the catalog.
Requirements for the major in music education, B.M., specialization in instrumental and general music
Admission to Music degree programs
Admission to the music degree programs at Oakland University (OU) is a two-tiered process, except for the B.A. in Music. The first step in the process for all students is the entrance audition. These auditions are held several times a year and determine whether or not a student will be admitted to OU in any of these degree programs. For all B.M. programs, the second step is the major standing audition, which determines whether students may continue in the program, and if they can be admitted into a professional program in the school.
Entrance auditions
Entrance audition days are held several times each year. The audition schedule and downloadable application are available on the
school website
. Please submit application to the department office. Students should be prepared to demonstrate proficiency in their proposed area of specialization.
Students seeking admission to Oakland University as music majors or auditioned music minors must audition for the music faculty.
Students who audition and do not enroll within two semesters must re-audition. Students who enroll and leave school for at least two semesters must re-audition.
Music students who enroll and leave school must re-audition and also retake the theory placement exam.
The Bachelor of Music degree is intended for students who wish pre-professional and professional preparation in music education and/or performance. Students should consult the Student Resources link and should also consult with the departmental adviser in the College of Arts and Sciences Advising Office to plan their degree program. See:
