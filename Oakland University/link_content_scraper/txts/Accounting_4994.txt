Bachelor of Science in Accounting Degree: The Oakland University Advantage
Our accounting degree pairs advanced academic preparation with hands-on experience, empowering you to rise quickly in your accounting career. You’ll develop a comprehensive skill set that lays the foundation for future managerial and executive roles.
Oakland’s Bachelor of Science in Accounting degree program offers you a number of benefits, including:
Exceptional faculty.
Our accounting major program is led by expert faculty who have achieved renown in global business and academia. Our small classes ensure plenty of face-to-face interaction with instructors — and nearly every course is taught by experienced faculty, not adjuncts or graduate students. Faculty mentors also guide you through your accounting internship experiences.
Real-world experience.
We’re located in a prosperous, diverse economic region that affords an almost infinite variety of accounting internship opportunities. More than half of our accounting majors supplement their classroom  education with professional workplace experience — and those experiences routinely lead to full-time employment after graduation.
Extensive professional connections.
The “Big 4” accounting firms (Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers) list Oakland University as a “preferred” school for new hires. Executives from three of these firms sit on our advisory board, ensuring that our accounting degree requirements align closely with employer needs. The top 14 accounting firms in Southeast Michigan have all hired at least one of our accounting degree alumni. And corporate recruiters for in-house accounting departments aggressively recruit our accounting majors.
Academic excellence.
Oakland University’s School of Business Administration holds elite dual accreditation in accounting and business from the Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business. This is a rare distinction that’s shared by only 1 percent of business schools worldwide.
An interdisciplinary business education.
You’ll gain a holistic understanding of business that places accounting within a broader context. This perspective helps you work well on teams, contribute to strategic decision-making, and ultimately advance beyond the accounting department into organizational leadership.
What Can You Do With Your B.S. in Accounting Degree?
Our accounting majors stand out in the job market for more than their spreadsheet skills. At Oakland University, you’ll also learn to exhibit professional qualities that impress potential employers. You’ll enjoy dozens of opportunities to meet employers on campus. In addition, our Bachelor of Science in Accounting degree program includes dedicated coursework focused on resume writing, interview techniques, business etiquette, job search skills, money management and many other aspects of career goal-setting and development.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects above-average growth for accounting jobs over the next decade. An accounting degree can put you on a long-term career trajectory that leads to upper management positions. You may choose to start your accounting career in areas such as:
