Nursing Ph.D.: The Oakland University Advantage
Through its history, the School of Nursing at Oakland University has helped create transformational change in nursing education, training and professional development. We created Michigan’s first Doctor of Nursing Practice degree and first forensic nursing program, and our high standards and commitment to innovation have brought us national recognition.
Our
nursing doctorate
builds on Oakland’s tradition of progressive nursing education by offering:
Outstanding research opportunities.
As a
nursing Ph.D.
student, you’ll play an active role in investigations related to nursing practice, patient outcomes and population-level health trends. A key program goal is to develop nurse scientists who can design effective responses to the escalating health care challenges our society faces.
High-profile faculty.
Oakland’s
nursing Ph.D.
faculty includes internationally recognized scholars in multiple specialties, including two endowed chairs. You’ll have the opportunity to work with leading researchers on health care subjects such as end-of-life care, palliative care, population health, gerontological nursing and health promotion, among other subjects.
Personalized, high-touch support.
You’ll belong to a diverse, tight-knit community in Oakland’s School of Nursing, enjoying strong relationships and camaraderie with professors and peers. Our
nursing Ph.D.
program welcomes students from all backgrounds, providing a positive environment that helps you reach your full potential.
Convenience.
Our
nursing doctorate
is built around online courses to accommodate professional nurses with full-time jobs. The format enables you to continue working while you earn the
nursing Ph.D.
, while creating opportunities for synergy between your academic and professional pursuits.
Accessibility.
You can enter Oakland’s
nursing doctorate
program as a post-bachelor’s, post-master’s, or post-DNP student, with coursework and training aligned to your level of prior education. We also have a highly affordable
nursing Ph.D.
program, with in-state tuition offered to out-of-state students and the Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) available to reduce debt loads for Ph.D. graduates who work in nurse faculty positions.
What Can You Do With a Nursing Ph.D.?
According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), a shortage of
Ph.D. nursing
faculty forced U.S. nursing schools to deny admission to more than 75,000 qualified applicants in the 2018-19 academic year. Persistent faculty shortages pose a serious challenge for the health care system, which faces growing demand for nursing care as the U.S. population ages.
Our
nursing Ph.D.
qualifies you for faculty positions in university and college nursing programs. In addition to training the next generation of nurses, you’ll be equipped to conduct research that improves nursing practices and overall health care quality.
A
nursing Ph.D.
can also lead to non-academic career opportunities in the health care system. You may find high-level jobs with employers such as:
Hospitals
Health care systems
Long-term care facilities
Pharmaceutical companies
Public health agencies
Health advocacy and social work organizations
