Graduate Catalog Addendum
Program description
Oakland University’s Master of Arts in Teaching in Elementary Education (MATEE) program is designed for individuals who hold a bachelor’s degree in another discipline and are now seeking a career in teaching. The MATEE program is a 5-semester (20-month) teacher certification program that will prepare individuals for a career in teaching at the elementary level. This is a dual certification program (grade bands PK-3 and 3-6) that combines teacher education coursework, three field placements in local schools, and a semester-long student teaching internship.
Program delivery
Courses are taken as a cohort with coursework beginning in the fall semester. All face-to-face classes are held on OU’s main campus two weekday evenings per week and up to one Saturday a month, in addition to some online coursework. Students are required to complete 120+ hours of field experiences prior to student teaching. During the field placements, students will actively engage in the classroom, observe instruction and classroom management, work with small groups of students, and implement lessons. Field placements are arranged to afford students depth, breadth, and diversity of authentic learning experiences in schools where they can apply what they are learning in a real classroom.

Degree requirements
The Master of Arts in Teaching in Elementary Education degree is awarded upon satisfactory completion of a minimum of 45 credits in an approved program of study. To be recommended for a Standard Michigan Teaching Certificate at the PK-3 and 3-6 grade bands, students must successfully complete requirements for the MAT in Elementary Education degree, earn a minimum grade of a B in EED 6950, and successfully pass the required MTTC exams. For certification, the state also requires a first aid and adult/child CPR training before certification may be recommended. Successful completion of our program and internship does not guarantee certification by the State of Michigan.

Satisfactory academic progress
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is the term used to denote a student’s successful completion of coursework toward a certificate or degree. Federal regulations require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor Satisfactory Academic Progress for all financial aid recipients each semester.
Students who fall behind in their coursework, or fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and completion of classes, may lose their eligibility for all types of federal, state and university aid. Contact the
Office of Financial Aid
for additional details.
Good academic standing
All graduate students are expected to remain in
good academic standing
throughout
the entire course of their graduate program. To be in good academic standing, a graduate student must make satisfactory progress toward fulfilling degree requirements, including the completion of critical degree milestones as set forth by the academic program. The student must also maintain a minimum semester and overall GPA of 3.0.
Good academic standing is a requirement for:
Holding a Graduate Assistantship
Receiving a fellowship or scholarship
Advancing to candidacy for a graduate degree
Going on a leave of absence
Obtaining a graduate certificate or degree from Oakland University.
Additionally, graduate students must meet all department academic standards which may be more stringent than the minimum set forth by the University.
Department requirements:
In order to remain in good standing, graduate students must earn a grade-point average of 3.0. No grade below 3.0 can be applied toward a graduate degree. Two-course grades below 3.0 or one below 2.0 automatically lead to an evaluation of progress and possible dismissal.
Graduate students who are not in good academic standing for any reason are subject to probation and/or dismissal from further graduate study.

Plan of study
All accepted applicants will be provided with a plan of study that details specific courses the students will use to satisfy their degree requirements. This program runs as a cohort and has a predetermined course schedule. The plan of study must be approved by the student and program adviser, then submitted by the student to Oakland University Graduate School.
Master’s and graduate certificate students must submit a department-approved plan of study by the end of their first semester of graduate coursework. Doctoral students must submit an approved plan of study prior to completion of the first year of coursework. (See the
Graduate Student Responsibility
section of this catalog.)
Note:  Credit granted for successful completion of a course toward an undergraduate degree program may not be repeated for a graduate degree. If a substitution is approved, the minimum number of program-approved graduate credits will be required. A
Petition of Exception - OU Course Waiver/ Substitution
requesting the substitution must be approved.
