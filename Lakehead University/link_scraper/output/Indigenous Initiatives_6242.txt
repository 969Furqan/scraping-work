Indigenous Language Instructor's Program
Welcome
Admission Requirements
Tuition & Fees
The Indigenous Language Instructor’s Program is designed to provide persons with a recognized* means of teaching their native language in their communities. Courses are also available for students who desire to become fluent in a particular language.
The only program in Ontario with a mandate from the Ontario College of Teachers to provide teacher certification in Algonquian languages, Lakehead’s NLIP is dedicated to increasing the number of Native language teachers. Our students not only have the unique opportunity to gain the credentials to teach their language but also the means to emerge as leaders devoted to the survival of Native language and culture.
As a student, you will learn Native language structure, pedagogical principles, and teaching techniques in an environment that respects, encompasses, and promotes traditional teaching practices and beliefs.
You will also gain knowledge of the traditional teachings and values inherent in Indigenous culture. Outside of your courses, you are welcome to participate in any of the cultural activities that take place in Thunder Bay and the surrounding area for the month of July which include:
Monday Night Potlucks
Wednesday Arts and Crafts Night
Sweat Lodge Ceremonies
Sunrise Ceremonies
Pow-Wow
Sweet Grass Ceremonies
…and more
*in accordance with the Ministry of Education
