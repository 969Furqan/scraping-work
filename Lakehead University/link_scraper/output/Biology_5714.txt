Biology
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Biology is the study of plants, animals and the diversity of life in an evolutionary context. As a Biology student you will gain insight into how organisms interact, how genes are inherited, how creatures evolve and much more. Our programs are practical and hands-on with research and fieldwork opportunities in almost every course to enhance in-class learning.
You will be exposed to the central aspects of Biology including:
Form and Function
Cell and Molecular Biology
Genetics
Evolution
Biodiversity
Systematics
Ecology and Environmental Biology
You have the freedom to study Biology in a way that suits your career aspirations. You may choose courses that will prepare you to become a professional biologist, or you can combine your biological studies with a major in Chemistry, Geography, Environmental Studies or Outdoor Recreation, Parks & Tourism.
Our program also offers 4 areas of concentration that will allow you to further study a particular area of interest including:
Animal Sciences
Biodiversity & Conservation
Plant Sciences
The small size of our department allows you to become involved with ongoing faculty research, ranging from ecology to biorefining. Exciting professional opportunities exist for you post-graduation with further study in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, veterinary medicine or graduate school.
The Lakehead Advantage
Our location in the Boreal Forest makes Lakehead University the ideal institution to study Biology. We host intensive local field trips and field schools for our undergraduate students, making the most of the environment and wildlife available to us. While many other universities have to travel to get this experience, we can host our field trips within the 3 hours allotted for a class or a lab.
As a Biology student you will have access to the
Lakehead University Instrumentation Lab
(LUIL)  and learn to operate the tools and equipment to conduct your own research and generate data yourself. Unlike other universities, you can utilize the lab as opposed to passing your samples on to a technician. This practical knowledge gives you an advantage when applying to graduate or professional school or a science-based job.
Our relatively small class sizes provide exceptional networking opportunities with faculty members. This is especially helpful if you are considering pursuing an Honours Thesis or research project as you will require an academic advisor. Our faculty is well connected within the community and the industry, making such relationships very conducive to summer job opportunities.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
Applying to Lakehead University is easy and we are here to help you along the way.

The program-specific prerequisite requirements do not apply to college transfer pathways. Refer to the agreements found
here
for more information on the admission requirements.
If you do not meet the program-specific prerequisite requirements for your program of choice, please contact Enrolment Services – Undergraduate Admissions to schedule an appointment with an Admissions Officer. An Admissions Officer can provide you with more information on how to enrol in the required prerequisite courses for your program of choice.
Step 3 – Apply Today!
Now that you have determined your admission requirements, your next step is to submit an application.
If you are interested in
full-time studies
, you can apply to Lakehead University using the Ontario Universities’ Application Centre (OUAC). The full-time applications can be found
here
. Before submitting your application, be sure to read the application instructions to ensure that you are using the correct application.
If you are interested in
part-time studies
, you can apply to Lakehead University using the Undergraduate Application form found
here
. Before submitting your application, be sure to read the application instructions to ensure that you are using the correct application.
In first year you are required to take:
Biology 1050 Introduction to Cell and Molecular Biology and Biology 1051 Introduction to Ecology, Evolution, and Biodiversity
Chemistry 1110 and 1130 – Introductory Chemistry I & II,
Mathematics 1171 and 1172 – Calculus I & II, or Mathematics 1151 and 1152 – Calculus I & II for Social Life and Sciences
In addition to three elective courses that must not be within the Department of Biology.
If you are considering a career in the health sciences, we advise you to take a Physics course as one of your available electives.
Your Biology and Chemistry courses will have corresponding lab components, and your Calculus courses will have tutorials in addition to in-class lecture. This will provide time to study and to interact with your professors and teaching assistants.
If you are considering graduate school we strongly encourage you to take Biology 4101 – Honours Thesis – in which you will research a problem in Biology, prepare a report and present your findings in a Biology department seminar. If you wish to register, you must arrange for a faculty supervisor before the beginning of fourth year.
Biology internships and research assistant positions are provided to students, either in the summer or during the academic year, as they become available. Pairing work experience with hands-on labs and in-class lecture is invaluable. Click
