Environmental Sustainability
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Studying Environmental Sustainability will prepare you to play a crucial role in protecting the ecosystems and living organisms that make up our environment. You will gain both the scientific expertise and practical experience needed to solve modern sustainability challenges in Canada and around the world.
Our program is known for producing environmentally conscious and responsible graduates with excellent communication skills and problem-solving abilities. You will be trained to meet the growing demands of interdisciplinary practitioners in the diverse fields of science and sustainability.
In addition to the core Environmental Sustainability courses, you will take courses in the following areas:
Biology
Environmental Chemistry
Environmental Economics
Geography
Geology
Natural Resource Management
We also offer a
Co-Operative Education
program if you are interested in gaining experience that surpasses typical fieldwork and research opportunities.
Lakehead Advantage
In addition to receiving an HBASc (Environmental Sustainability Major), you may choose to combine your degree with a specialization in Environmental Biotechnology, a Concurrent Education degree (Primary/Junior) or our Co-Operative Education program. Each of these options allows you to expand your knowledge and application of Environmental Sustainability and provides you with a competitive edge post-graduation.
Our department is relatively small and conducive to interaction with both your peers and professors. We encourage you to take advantage of the friendly, personal learning environment and reach out to faculty for course help as well as potential job and/or mentorship opportunities.
Accreditation
The HBASc in Environmental Sustainability has been granted national accreditation by the Canadian Environmental Accreditation Commission (CEAC), the certifying body of the Environmental Careers Organization
(ECO Canada)
.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
