Indigenous Nursing Entry Program
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Tuition & Fees
The Indigenous Nursing Entry Program (INEP) is an eight month program intended for students of First Nations (status or non-status), Métis, or Inuit people who do not meet the regular or mature student entry requirements for the Bachelor of Science, Nursing (BScN) program at Lakehead University. The INEP is designed to provide the necessary skills and academic preparation for successful transition into Nursing studies.  Successful completion of  INEP (with a minimum 70% average) will ensure your eligibility for admission to the Bachelor of Science Nursing degree program at Lakehead University. INEP students who attain an overall average of 80% or higher will be eligible for the 3 year compressed BScN program.
You can realize your dreams to become a qualified nurse by beginning your studies with the INEP here at Lakehead University.
Our innovative programming honours and celebrates Indigenous heritage while providing culturally appropriate supports and services. Academic advising and tutoring are available, as well as other supports, such as Elder visits, cultural activities, personal counselling, and assistance with community connections for services such as housing and child care.
Our mission is clear:
"To improve the health care of Indigenous people by increasing the number of Indigenous Nurses who would provide culturally appropriate care. The Indigenous Nursing Entry Program provides access to a Baccalaureate Nursing Education for those of Aboriginal ancestry who do not meet the regular University entrance requirements."
