Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Explore the modern applications of bio-molecular research in anthropology, chemistry, biology, and physics as a student of Applied Life Sciences. This
interdisciplinary program
focuses on the study of living organisms at the bio-molecular or cellular level, and the human manipulation of molecular biological processes, with
hands-on learning
through laboratory courses, research opportunities, and internships.
You will acquire skills in cutting-edge molecular biology, biotechnology, and diagnostic methods in our world-renowned labs including the Paleo DNA Laboratory.
The Applied Life Sciences major can include a concentration in Biomedical Sciences, as well as specializations in Biotechnology or Experimental Life Sciences.

The balance of your courses will be electives. We recommend taking an English course to develop your writing and communication skills.
Undergraduate Research
As Canada’s #1 Undergraduate Research University, we make research in your undergraduate years a reality.
We offer formalized research internships in Ancient DNA (Anthropology) and Biology, available as elective courses in third and fourth year.
The Ancient DNA Internship is a three-week laboratory course, whereas the Biology Research Internship takes place in either the spring or summer session and consists of 120 hours of research. These courses are extremely beneficial to develop your lab skills, enhance your understanding of a particular topic and set yourself apart from students with a similar background.
Concentration & Specialization Opportunities
We have a number of elective courses that can be combined to receive a specialization or concentration within your Applied Life Sciences major, or simply to help develop your passion on a particular topic. These include:
Forensic Anthropology
Human Skeletal and Dental Biology
Physiology of Exercise
Biogeography
Biology of Food Safety
Introduction to Optics
For a full listing of our recommended elective courses, visit our
Academic Calendar

Accessible Faculty and Mentorship
Our small class sizes promote hands-on skill development and individual attention from professors. Our faculty is readily accessible and always willing to help. We also have faculty advisors that can assist you if you are interested in continuing your education in medicine, veterinary medicine, etc.
As an Honours student, you will have the opportunity to work very closely with a faculty member on your Honours thesis project, contributing to groundbreaking research within this evolving field of study.
Clubs & Societies
The Lakehead University Student Union (LUSU) is proud to support nearly
100 clubs
across the Thunder Bay and Orillia campuses including the Pre-Med Society, Association of Biology Students, and more.
