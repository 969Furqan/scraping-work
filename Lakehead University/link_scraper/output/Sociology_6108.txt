Sociology
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
The study of Sociology emphasizes the social relationships between people, communities and cultures. By exploring fundamental sociological theories, contemporary thinkers, and a variety of research methods, you will have the opportunity to examine topics including:
Health and Aging
Marriage and the Family
Crime and Deviance
Media and Popular Culture
Science and Technology
Gender and Sexuality
Education
Northern Communities
Discrimination
Social Change
Research and hands-on application is at the core of our programs. You will graduate with the necessary skills to facilitate quantitative and qualitative research and to think creatively and inquisitively in order to better understand social patterns, behaviours and issues.
Our faculty is actively engaged in diverse areas of research such as Gerontology, Education, Health, Demography, Media, Work and Occupations, Social Psychology, and Northern Studies, providing you with well-rounded course options taught by some of the foremost leaders in the field.
It is our goal to enhance your knowledge of the society in which you live and to increase your ability to think independently and critically.  You will graduate with a strong understanding of social interaction, preparing you for success in virtually any profession.
The Lakehead Advantage
Our small department gives you access to professors and graduate students/teaching assistants as needed. We have an open-door policy and encourage you to take advantage of the intimate learning environment to increase your comprehension and foster networking opportunities.
Due to Thunder Bay's large Aboriginal population and location in Northwestern Ontario, we regularly incorporate Indigenous issues into our course content, starting in first year. This equips you with the compassion and understanding to better engage with and support such populations both personally and professionally, a major advantage to numerous careers in the public and private sector.
Our courses utilize group work and collaborative learning, giving you regular opportunities to develop interprofessional skills needed to succeed in a sociology-based career. This departure from strict lecture learning gives you the ability to think independently and critically about sociological theory as well as the broad range of topics you will encounter.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.

As a first year sociology student, you will be required to take:
Sociology 1100 – Introduction to Sociology
The balance of your other courses in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Introduction to Sociology will expose you to topics in society, culture, social interaction and power relations to help expose you to a number of areas of interest within the discipline.
We balance in-class lecture with experiential learning opportunities, including research labs and field trips. We make it our priority to exemplify theoretical knowledge with real-world experience and visit local organizations whenever possible, such as Shelter House Thunder Bay.
Our focus on research means you will graduate with the ability to design and conduct questionnaires and interviews, gather historical and present-day data, and interpret your findings with a perceptive theoretical lens. Our students routinely secure discipline-specific employment, due to their practical background in research methods and analysis. Many go on to pursue post-graduate degrees in fields such as sociology, education, law, public health, and medicine.
Every year we host a series of workshops for third and fourth year students with information about how to apply to graduate school and obtain valuable scholarships. This sets our students up for success and ensures everyone has equal access to beneficial resources and information.
