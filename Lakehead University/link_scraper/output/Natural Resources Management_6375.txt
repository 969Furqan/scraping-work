Natural Resources Management
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Natural resources management is the stewardship of forested public and private landscapes, with the intention of creating a
balanced approach to sustainable ecosystem management
with regard to many of the social, economic, and environmental challenges which face us now and into the future.
Our Faculty prepares you to take an active role, either as a forester or an environmental manager, in the sustainability of Canada’s most important resources.
You will follow a common curriculum for the first two years of your program, providing you with a background in the biological, social, and operational fundamentals of forestry, and its relationship to our ecosystems. After two years, you will choose to complete either the Honours Bachelor of Science in Forestry or the Honours Bachelor of Environmental Management.
