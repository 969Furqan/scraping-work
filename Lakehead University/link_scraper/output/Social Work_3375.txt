Social Work is a versatile and influential profession that facilitates positive change whether its working to develop social policy, assisting marginalized groups, providing counselling to individuals and families, or promoting social change.
Lakehead University's School of Social Work delivers a generalist undergraduate degree with a northern focus, based on an holistic view of social work practice.
Our courses blend in-class learning with field placements, in settings including correctional facilities, psychiatric hospitals, schools, or child welfare agencies, designed to develop critical thinking, effective communication, problem-solving, and interdisciplinary skills.
As a student at our Thunder Bay campus, concentrations in Indigenous Learning, and Gender and Women's Studies are available to broaden your expertise within the field.
Our program is fully accredited by the Canadian Association for Social Work Education and will provide you with a challenging and meaningful experience, applicable to a range of professional practice settings.
