Bioinformatics
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Bioinformatics is the application of information technology to the field of molecular biology. As a relatively new area of study, we are one of the very few universities in Canada that offer this program from year one.
Our Department of Bioinformatics integrates tools and theories from several disciplines including:
Mathematics
Computer Science
Biology
Chemistry
Physics
Whether designing a new life-saving drug, decoding a genome sequence or developing algorithms to analyze medical images, Bioinformaticians solve problems that arise from the analysis of biological data. As a student skilled in Bioinformatics, you will be at the forefront of this newly emerging field which has a widespread impact on the way we approach important global issues and topics including healthcare and sustainability.
You will gain the necessary education and training in all of the component fields and insight into:
the complex interactions of living systems
big data collection and analysis
the physical and chemical nature of the environment
building descriptive models based on biological data
theoretical biology
Our program is well-rounded and small in size allowing for one-on-one interaction with educators and many research opportunities. Additionally, we maintain close relationships with local knowledge-based businesses and organizations which contribute to unique course content and job opportunities post-graduation.
Lakehead Advantage
We are one of the few universities in Canada that offer a Bioinformatics program from first year onward. The benefit of receiving a Bioinformatics degree rather than a Biology degree with a specialization in Bioinformatics is that your education is far more multidisciplinary. Three to four years of your undergraduate are focused on applying your knowledge to the field.
Our small class sizes promote hands-on skill development and individual attention from professors and teaching assistants. Our faculty is readily accessible and always willing to help. As an Honours student, you will have the opportunity to work very closely with a faculty member on your Honours thesis project, contributing to groundbreaking research within this new and evolving field of study.
You will have many opportunities to work as a summer
research assistant
, giving you the necessary work experience and one-on-one time with educators that are not available at larger universities. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of our program, you can inquire about positions within the departments of Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
Applying to Lakehead University is easy and we are here to help you along the way.
