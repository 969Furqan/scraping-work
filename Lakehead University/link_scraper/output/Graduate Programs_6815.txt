The Gerontology Program collaborates with five departments including Psychology, to provide students with an innovative, interdisciplinary learning perspective. Students have the opportunity to access multifaceted resources and work together with complementary disciplines.
Research and theory in Gerontology is reviewed, and the thesis or major project taken in the collaborating academic unit will have a gerontological focus.
For additional information on the Interdisciplinary Graduate Specialization in Gerontology, please
visit the Gerontology website
.
The Gerontology programs are:
Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology (MA)
Master of Arts in Sociology (MA)
Master of Education (MEd)
Master of Social Work (MSW)
Master of Science in Psychological Science (MSc)
Master of Science in Kinesiology

Admission Requirements for Masters
Applicants for admission must be graduates of a recognized university, college, or institute as well as show evidence of scholarly achievement. Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, degree students must have a four year bachelor's degree or its equivalent with at least second class standing (B) based on their last 20 half courses or equivalent.
For applicants from countries that follow a British-patterned grading system, please note:
Overall standings are normally reported in lieu of an average. The CGPA can be determined on the basis of annual or overall standings as reported on the transcript or degree certificate.
A minimum grade of B, or Second Class, Upper Division, is required.
The National Diploma and Higher National Diploma are not recognized for admission to a graduate-level program.
Be sure to include a copy of your institution grading scale when uploading your transcripts.
If in doubt, you may wish to order a WES International Credential Advantage (iCap) report from wes.org
An applicant holding a degree other than one in the discipline area to which admission is sought will be considered on the basis of courses taken and academic standing.
Meeting the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission. No candidate will be admitted unless the academic unit recommends admission. All applicants will be advised by the Office of Graduate Studies in writing of their admission status.

Program Specific Requirements
In addition to the general admission requirements for Master programs,
the following requirements also apply
:
Students normally apply for acceptance to the Collaborative Program with Specialization in Gerontology at the same time as they apply for admission to the graduate program of the collaborating academic unit.  However, in
exceptional cases
, students may apply for admission to the Gerontology Specialization during their first year of graduate studies.
Students wishing to acquire a graduate degree with a Specialization in Gerontology
must be admitted to the graduate program in one of the collaborating academic units
: Education, Health Sciences, Kinesiology, Psychology, Public Health, Social Work or Sociology.  Once a student has been accepted as a graduate student in one of these academic units, the application will be reviewed for approval by the Gerontology Graduate Committee.  Preference will be given to students who have a major or minor in Gerontology, have taken undergraduate courses in gerontology or with gerontology content, or have relevant work or volunteer experience dealing with issues of aging.
