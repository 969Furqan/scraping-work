Water Science
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Our Water Resource Science program is the only undergraduate program of its kind in Canada, and will provide you with the necessary skills and scientific knowledge to protect and advocate for our most valuable resource.
The study of Water Resource Science emphasizes how the ecology, physical processes and chemistry of natural systems interact and produce the diverse environments present on Earth. As a student, you will learn:
The effects of human activity on the environment
Techniques for rehabilitating damaged systems
Water-related public policies
The biological, physical and chemical aspects of aqueous systems
Our well-rounded curriculum is designed to give you the opportunity to look at wetland, lake, river and groundwater systems from various perspectives, and explore their interconnectedness. In addition to the program's unique subject matter, its interdisciplinary nature and focus on hands-on, field-based learning sets it apart from other environmental studies and environmental sciences programs across Canada.
Lakehead Advantage
Our program is the only undergraduate program in Canada specializing in water resources. Our location on Lake Superior, the largest lake in the world -surrounded by rivers, small inland lakes, and the boreal forest makes Lakehead University the best possible institution to study Water Resource Science. This setting provides a natural laboratory where you can run analytical procedures in the lab within minutes of collecting fresh samples.
We host a variety of field trips in the area, and regularly hold classes on the bank of the river flowing through campus. This immersive learning experience is unparalleled, as many other universities are located far from woodlands, wetlands, and undisturbed natural systems.
In addition to your BSc/HBSc in Water Resource Science, you may pursue a
Specialization in Applied Environmental Water Management
. This option requires you to complete your second year at Confederation College in the Environmental Technician Diploma program. Upon graduation, you will be eligible to receive your Water and Wastewater Operator in Training (OIT) and your Entry Level Drinking Water Operator certifications.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
Applying to Lakehead University is easy and we are here to help you along the way.
