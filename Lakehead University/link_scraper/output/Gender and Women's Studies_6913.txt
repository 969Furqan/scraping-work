Gender and Women's Studies
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
The field of Gender and Women's Studies has transformed dramatically since its introduction to Lakehead University in 1990. Alongside women’s experiences and gendered systems, you will examine elements of:
Sexuality
Queer Theory
Law
Masculinity
Transnational Activism
Ecofeminism
Social Justice
Pop Culture
Embodiment
Through these topics and more, it is our goal to demonstrate how people are constrained by various ideological notions and how these notions can be challenged to facilitate equality.
Our Department of Women’s Studies takes an interdisciplinary approach to feminism. Our faculty members are prominent in the fields of feminist legal studies, women’s health, queer studies, cultural and new media studies and teach related courses that easily springboard our students into the Masters of Social Justice and related postgraduate programs, law schools across Canada, midwifery, policing, and many others.
As a Women’s Studies Honours student you are free to combine your studies with a joint major in Gerontology, Psychology, History, English, Indigenous Learning, Sociology, Outdoor Recreation, or Concurrent Education, as well as Concentration or Specialization options with Social Work.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
The Lakehead Advantage
We are the only department at Lakehead University that fulfills the intersectional diversity training, in each of our classes, now required for all Ontario public sector employees. An intersectional approach to diversity training takes into account historical, social, and political contexts - recognizing the unique experience of individuals based on their social location. Taking even one of our Gender and Women's Studies courses fulfills this core competency of diversity.
Our focus on activism and professionalization as part of nearly all of our undergraduate courses means you will experience the hands-on application of theories learned in class, and understand how what you learn will connect you to the job market after graduation.
As part of our curriculum, our students take on project development, volunteer positions and community engagement activities in partnership with organizations throughout the District of Thunder Bay to help achieve greater gender equality. We have had students work with the Thunder Bay Shelter House, the Regional Food Distribution Association of Northwestern Ontario and much more.
Applying to Lakehead University is easy and we are here to help you along the way.

As a first year Women’s Studies major you are required to take:
Women’s Studies 1100, Madonna to Madonna: Women’s and Gender Studies
This course examines gender and feminism from a variety of perspectives exposing you to topics you may want to explore in second, third and fourth year.
The remaining balance of your first year courses are mainly within the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, such as Languages, Philosophy and/or Music. Electives are available in other Faculties. If you have chosen to pursue a double major, you will have additional required courses tailored to your area(s) of study.
Women’s Studies 1100 is the foundation for more highly specialized courses within the discipline including:
Ecofeminism
Queer Studies
Women, Food & Environments
Typewriter Girls and Hackerettes
Gender, Bodies & Sexuality
Activism is a very important focus within our Department, and some courses have a required element of community engagement to demonstrate how to produce systems of greater equality. This may include working with women with various lived experiences, the underprivileged, and/or community organizations and advocacy groups such as the Thunder Bay Shelter House.
Paid undergraduate research opportunities within the Department of Women’s Studies are available through hiring competitions in both third and fourth year. Many of our students have gone on to publish papers and attend conferences. For more information please contact the Department of Women’s Studies at 343-8625 or speak to a faculty member directly.
We work to integrate professionalization opportunities for all of our undergraduate students. We aim to equip our graduates with the knowledge to facilitate equality and to succeed at applying that knowledge in a professional manner and environment.
