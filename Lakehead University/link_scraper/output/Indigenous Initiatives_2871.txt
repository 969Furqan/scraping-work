Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Tuition & Fees
Our
Indigenous Transition Year Program (ITYP)
is intended for First Nations (status or non-status), Métis, or Inuit people who do not meet the regular or mature student university entry requirements, or who require academic preparation to become eligible for admission to Lakehead University.
Our innovative programming honours and celebrates
Indigenous
heritage while providing culturally appropriate support services. Academic advising and tutoring are also available, contributing to an environment conducive to success and support.
Over eight months you will complete core courses in English, Study Skills, Science and an elective of limited choice. You will develop:
Essential research, study, and communication skills
Knowledge about
Indigenous
history, traditions, and culture
Critical thinking and problem solving skills
University program planning abilities
Applied Science skills
With the support of faculty, peers and the community, your successful completion of the program will ensure your eligibility for admission to a Lakehead University program of your choosing*.
*Prerequisites apply for some programs. Check the
Admissions page
for more details or contact the Office of Admissions & Recruitment.
Lakehead Advantage
As a graduate of the Indigenous Transition Year Program, you will be academically prepared for admission to a Lakehead University program, and you will also earn three university credits. Depending on your program of choice, these credits may be applied toward the completion of your degree. This gives you a head start on your undergraduate degree and will allow you to take a partial course load as you move into upper years of study.
The program size ranges from 15-30 students, all of whom take the same classes together. This is to ensure you, as a student, will experience your education in a stable and comfortable setting with strong peer support. Many students are from rural communities and bring their families and children with them as they work through the program.
