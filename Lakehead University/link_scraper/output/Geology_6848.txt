Geology
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Geology is a qualitative science that combines elements of physics, chemistry, biology and other sciences to study the Earth, the processes that make up the Earth, and the history of our planet. As a student in the program you will:
Examine rocks, minerals, and sediment
Study environmental hazards
Explore elements that make up the planets and moons in our solar system
And learn much more about our Earth's 4.5 billion-year history
Our location amidst the Canadian Shield functions as an outdoor lab and classroom. Our faculty regularly holds classes outside and organizes field trips and extended field schools to take advantage of the superior environment and give you practical training that is highly valued by the industry from day one.
Our faculty collaborates with industry, government, and other academics with research covering the spectrum, from pure to applied science. This breadth of expertise and course content can meet the interests of any student in the program.
Our program is designed to ensure that you will have the necessary courses to register as a Professional Geologist with APGO, which is required to work as a geologist in Ontario. This experience makes our students highly employable post-graduation.
The Lakehead Advantage
The fundamental goal of our Geology programs is to teach you how to map and identify rocks. This sets our students apart and contributes to a very high employment rate post-graduation working for organizations such as the Ontario Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada.
Our location among the Canadian Shield is ideal for this type of organic, hands-on learning many other universities across Canada have to travel for hours to provide. Our field trips and extended field schools take place in Thunder Bay and the surrounding area, giving you great opportunities to apply in-class learning to real-world situations and materials.
Additionally, our strategic location has allowed us to maintain strong industry and community connections to facilitate summer research opportunities, mentorship, and experiential learning to supplement class time.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.

Chemistry 1110 & 1130
– Introductory Chemistry I & II
English 1015 – Introduction to Academic Writing OR English 1016 – Introduction to Professional Writing
One half course elective
You will experience a balance of lectures, seminars, labs and field work to ensure a well-rounded education
Our first year Geology courses will expose you to a broad range of topics that you will study more in-depth as you proceed throughout your degree, including:
Mineralogy
Petrology
Environmental Geology
Economic Geology
Sedimentology
Geophysics
Plate Tectonics
We have two student associations for our Geology students, the Geological Association of Lakehead University (GALU) and the Society of Economic Geologists (SEG) Student Chapter. Both organizations host a variety of events, workshops and field trips to engage you within the university and the field of study as a whole. In the past, SEG Student Chapter has organized field trips with other Chapters to exciting locations such as Iceland and Sweden.
Field work is a large focus of our programs. In first year you will participate in two, one-day field trips on campus followed by a seven-day field school in second year and a 2-week field school in fourth year – all of which takes place in Northwestern Ontario. There are additional opportunities to gain field experience as many of our graduate students hire undergraduates as field assistants in the summer.
Our location within the heart of the Canadian Shield means that geology students regularly find
summer employment
with the mineral exploration industry that is active in the area. There are also opportunities spend your summers in other locations with these companies.
