Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
The study of environmental issues is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary, taking into consideration socio-economic, cultural and political actions and consequences in addition to scientific analysis. Our Environmental Studies program will provide you with the background to understand and evaluate environmental issues and solutions from a multitude of perspectives. You will gain the business skills, scientific expertise and practical experience needed to solve modern environmental and sustainability challenges.
Our Environmental Studies programs contain a core of common courses, plus courses required for a major in one of three disciplines:
Biology
Earth Science
Geography
Each program contains both Science and Social Sciences & Humanities components to ensure you receive a well-rounded background in modern environmental challenges.
If you are interested in majoring in Geography, you have the opportunity to graduate with an Honours Bachelor of Environmental Studies or an Honours Bachelor of Environmental Science, depending on whether you choose to emphasize Science or Social Sciences electives.
As a Geography or Biology major, you may choose to combine your Environmental Studies/Science degree with a Concurrent Education degree to teach at the Intermediate/Senior level.
Lakehead Advantage
Our location in the heart of Northwestern Ontario, surrounded by diverse forests, lakes and other unique geographical features, makes Lakehead University the ideal institution to learn about Environmental Studies. We maintain great relationships with regional organizations dedicated to ecological health and outdoor education, facilitating experiential learning and fieldwork opportunities in one of the most beautiful and diverse landscapes Canada has to offer.
The multidisciplinary approach of our program is unique to Lakehead University. As a graduate, you will have an advanced conceptual and practical understanding of the scientific and the social, cultural and political factors that are affecting our environment. This is very attractive to employers as many jobs in the field require you to work with various organizations, agencies and people from different backgrounds.
As a Biology, Geography or Earth Science major, you will have the ability to take experiential learning courses that supplement in-class lectures with off-campus labs, field trips and weekend excursions to gain hands-on experience. The topics vary from year to year and will provide you with a professional advantage post-graduation, due to the focus on practical learning and technique development.
