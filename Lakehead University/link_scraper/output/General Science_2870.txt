General Science
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Our General Science program is a great choice if you are looking for a multidisciplinary education that allows you the freedom to explore your interests. It is very easy to move from the General Science program into a specific major at any point during your undergraduate degree.
Our General Science program has 10 departments for you to choose courses from:
Anthropology
Biology
Chemistry
Computer Science
Economics
Geography
Mathematical Sciences
Geology
Sustainability Sciences
Physics
You are also able to take courses in Environmental Studies, Applied Life Sciences, Environmental Science and Water Resource Sciences
These departments can be arranged into four subfields if you have determined a topical interest:
Life Sciences
This area focuses on the study of living organisms and how those living systems work. Our natural world is reduced to its most basic principles to observe patterns in organisms from bacteria to humans. Learn more about Applied Life Science, Anthropology, Bioinformatics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics within this area.
Environmental Science & Policy
This area studies the distribution and interaction between humans and the physical features of our world. You will focus on understanding and evaluating environmental issues and choices in a sound scientific manner. Learn more about Earth Sciences, Economics, Geography, Geoarchaeology and Water Resource Science within this area.
Physical Science & Mathematics
Physical Science & Mathematics is about problem solving. You will focus on understanding structures in our day-to-day life and the theories behind them including the study of matter and how matter interacts. Dynamic modelling is a key element of the programs within this area. Learn more about Bioinformatics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematical Sciences and Physics.
Technology
This area is all about using the right tools to analyze the data in our world. These tools enable us to shape the future as they study physical characteristics of the world and beyond. Communications, information storage and human-computer interaction are common features of this area. Learn more about Computer Science, Bioinformatics and Physics.
Lakehead Advantage
Our faculty members are very involved in research at a national and international level. As a General Science student you will have many opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research on various topics including condensed matter, behavioural ecology, quantum-chemical exploration and DNA forensics. This hands-on approach to learning and well-rounded lab experience prepares you for success in any field, professional position or post-graduate training.
We have a number of dedicated, accessible resources to assist with research and to supplement your in-class studies including:
Lakehead University Centre for Analytical Services (LUCAS) Lab
Science Workshop
GIS Research Lab
Lakehead University Instrumentation Lab (LUIL)
Unlike other universities, you will be trained in the operation of lab equipment to gather and analyze your own data rather than passing it on to a technician.
We also offer the ability to do a joint BSc degree with a Bachelor of Education (BEd) in Native Education at the primary, junior, intermediate and senior levels. This is particularly beneficial if you wish to teach in Northwestern Ontario.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
Applying to Lakehead University is easy and we are here to help you along the way.

The General Science program strives to overcome the restrictions of traditional programs by allowing as much latitude as possible when choosing courses. Therefore, first year requirements are very flexible and driven by your interests.
Five credits must be taken within the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies such as Chemistry, Biology, Physics or Calculus.
Out of the 15 courses you will complete to successfully attain your BSc, no more than four may be taken outside of the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies and the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, as well as the Faculty of Education if you are pursuing a joint Native Education degree. If you wish to major after first year, these requirements will change based on your field of choice.
We encourage you to get involved in our Science Outreach Programs - Science Olympics, Faculty of Science & Environmental Studies Speaker Series and Superior Science - held throughout the academic year and in the summer.
Participating as a mentor in the Science Olympics and for Superior Science is a great way to gain experience in the field and add to your resume, especially if you are considering teaching in the future. Our Speaker Series is always diverse and informative and will undoubtedly open your eyes to new topics and ideas.
If you are interested in attending a professional workshop or giving a presentation based on your research, the Science & Environmental Studies (SES) Undergraduate Conference Travel Award can help you do so. Each year 10 awards are presented by the Dean of Science & Environmental Studies to help students expand their knowledge and represent Lakehead University. This is a great opportunity for those considering graduate studies.
