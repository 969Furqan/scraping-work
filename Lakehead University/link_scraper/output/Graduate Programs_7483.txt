The Graduate Diploma in Management (GDM) is a flexible way for professionals to develop critical skills and business knowledge for their next step in their professional careers. This program is open to domestic applicants only.
Overview
Not all learners are able to commit to a graduate degree program. The Graduate Diploma in Management (GDM) allows students to gain a customized management credential that can be used to address their individual learning needs. Learners who are successful in the GDM may also have the option to transfer into the MBA program upon completion.
To earn this diploma, students must successfully complete two courses from list A, and two from list B.
While the program is available online or in person, please note that each course is typically only offered online once every 3 years.

BUSI 5055 - Contemporary Issues in Organizations
BUSI 5071 - Strategic Management
BUSI 5033 - Project Management
BUSI 5318 - Organizational Behaviour

Admission Requirements for Masters
Applicants for admission must be graduates of a recognized university, college, or institute as well as show evidence of scholarly achievement. Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, degree students must have a four year bachelor's degree or its equivalent with at least second class standing (B) based on their last 20 half courses or equivalent.
For applicants from countries that follow a British-patterned grading system, please note:
Overall standings are normally reported in lieu of an average. The CGPA can be determined on the basis of annual or overall standings as reported on the transcript or degree certificate.
A minimum grade of B, or Second Class, Upper Division, is required.
The National Diploma and Higher National Diploma are not recognized for admission to a graduate-level program.
Be sure to include a copy of your institution grading scale when uploading your transcripts.
If in doubt, you may wish to order a WES International Credential Advantage (iCap) report from wes.org
An applicant holding a degree other than one in the discipline area to which admission is sought will be considered on the basis of courses taken and academic standing.
Meeting the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission. No candidate will be admitted unless the academic unit recommends admission. All applicants will be advised by the Office of Graduate Studies in writing of their admission status.
