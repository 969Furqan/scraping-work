Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
The field of engineering is generally associated with finding solutions for real world problems in an analytical fashion using the math, science and problem-solving skills. At Lakehead we believe engineers must also possess excellent communication skills as well as an understanding of the business, legal, and societal issues that impact development of the technological products and processes required to meet the demands of a global economy.
As a civil engineer, you will be involved in the planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation of engineering projects including as buildings, airports, highways, dams and power, water supply, bridges, and industrial facilities.
You will tackle design and research work in highway geometrics and transportation systems, high-performance concretes, environmental issues, watershed analysis, foundations, and slope stability projects or structural analysis and design engineering.
Our Civil Engineering program is accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB).
We offer several entry points into our Bachelor of Engineering programs to accommodate you at any stage of your education.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
Applying to Lakehead University is easy and we are here to help you along the way.
