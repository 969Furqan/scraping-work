Tuition & Fees
Lakehead University’s Faculty of Business Administration has one of the finest undergraduate business programs in Canada, producing
exceptional business leaders
through innovative programming that includes mentorship, consulting opportunities, and participation in national and international business competitions.
All students gain a comprehensive understanding of core business disciplines early in the program before digging deeper into fields of study that offer a range of advanced courses.
Our Faculty of Business Administration has joined the ranks of elite business schools by earning our Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) certification. Only 6% of business programs worldwide have been accredited with the AACSB certification. This globally-recognized hallmark of excellence guarantees you will experience a challenging and relevant curriculum delivered by the most highly-qualified faculty.
We are also accredited by the Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA) of Ontario, with all Accounting majors meeting the requirements of the CPA Prerequisite Education Program (PREP) upon graduation.
Our Finance major program participates in the CFA Institute University Affiliation Program by incorporating at least 70% of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Program Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK) and placing emphasis on the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.
Human Resources Management majors graduate with the required courses for use toward one of the Certified Human Resources designations (CHRP, CHRL, CHRE) as approved by the Human Resources Professionals Association (HRPA).
Minors are available for Honours Bachelor of Commerce students in their third or fourth years in either Accounting, Business Finance, Human Resources/Industrial Relations, Business Analytics and Information Systems or Marketing.
