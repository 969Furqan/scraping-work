Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
The sustainability of our environment and natural resources is a pressing 21
st
century issue. Our Honours Bachelor of Science in Resource and Environmental Economics program combines the academic structure of an economics degree with the scientific depth of an environmental science degree to help you understand how economic activity impacts the world around us. In light of growing concerns of climate change, Environmental Economists are in high demand in an effort to improve management strategies.
As a Resource and Environmental Economics student, you will examine resource allocation and decision-making processes with respect to policies related to water quality, air pollution, waste disposal, and climate change. The natural resources component of the program will focus on the economics of resource extraction, resource depletion, and sustainability.
Our program combines fundamentals from the following disciplines:
Economics
Environmental Studies
Mathematics
Political Science
Biology
Philosophy
History
Much like the economy, the environment and the discussion surrounding is constantly evolving. New theories and topics are always emerging in the field, making Resource and Environmental Economics a very exciting and ground-breaking discipline.
Lakehead Advantage
Our small class sizes facilitate individual attention from professors, and a student-centered learning environment conducive to exploring new ways of thinking. Our core faculty members are leaders in their field and active researchers on an international scale. Each year we offer Special Topics courses that coincide with the needs and interests of both our students and our faculty. These courses provide learning and research opportunities unique to our institution.
Our distinctive location in lush Northwestern Ontario makes this program especially pertinent to environmental organizations and First Nations communities in the surrounding area. We are constantly incorporating relevant and local content into our courses to better illustrate information and theories taught in-class. Many of our students remain in Northwestern Ontario to work post-graduation as there is an abundance of job opportunities for those interested in Environmental Economics and Environmental Science.
