Tuition & Fees
Lakehead’s Nursing program creates a
supportive learning environment
to help you apply a broad range of concepts from the sciences and liberal arts when caring for people of all ages and backgrounds.
You will learn to become an active member of an interprofessional health care team that can meet the needs of society while maximizing healthcare outcomes through communication, health promotion, and health protection strategies.
Our faculty is on the cutting edge of Nursing knowledge and regularly incorporate their research into the classroom with topics related to women's health, the aging process, nursing ethics, nursing care of oncology patients and those with cardiovascular disease, and much more.
Should you plan to work as a Registered Nurse in northern, rural or remote settings,  know that our emphasis on Indigenous health and wellness will provide you with insight and preparation for these important areas of nursing practice.
We also offer our 4-year Nursing program at
Seven Generations Education Institute in Kenora, Fort Frances and Sioux Lookout campuses
starting in September 2024.

Our focus on experiential learning and professional socialization makes our program unique compared to other similar programs across Canada.
Clinical Practice
Our emphasis on clinical practice, starting in first year, sets Lakehead University Nursing apart from other programs.  Many other Nursing programs do not provide these opportunities until second or third year. You will graduate with a more developed understanding of the professional nursing role, and of interpersonal and interprofessional care in diverse settings, giving you a professional advantage.

We have had students complete senior clinical courses in places such as Thailand, England, Finland, Africa, Sweden and New Zealand. This opportunity enhances your university experience and exposes you to health care practices around the world
Personal Campus Environment
Our small class sizes
facilitate a close and interactive student experience from first year, providing undergraduate students with opportunities to easily acquaint themselves with professors in the Nursing program and become involved with professors’ research projects.
