Our Department of Chemistry offers a graduate program that provides students with diverse opportunities across the subdisciplines of analytical, biochemical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. Students who successfully complete the program will achieve a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree.
The specific research interests of our full-time and adjunct faculty members include:
Electrochemistry and surface analysis
Material science
Pulp and paper research
Organometallic chemistry and catalysis
Organic synthesis
Aqueous silicon chemistry
Photochemistry
Environmental and medicinal chemistry
It normally takes two years to complete the program requirements, which include term courses that are tailored to meet the student's needs and interests; a research-based thesis project supervised by one or more of the faculty members; and two Departmental research seminars.
Some important points regarding graduate level research within the Department of Chemistry:
The excellent faculty-to-graduate student ratio ensures a strong interaction between graduate students and members of the Department
Extensive funding from government granting agencies [e.g.,
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)
and the
Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI)
], private industry, and Lakehead University has contributed to the tremendous expansion in research infrastructure available to researchers and graduate students in the Department
Several members of the Department of Chemistry and their graduate students collaborate with various companies and agencies, including
Bowater Pulp and Paper Canada
and the
Northwestern Ontario Regional Cancer Centre
Many successful M.Sc. graduates from the Department of Chemistry at Lakehead University go on to pursue Ph.D. studies at other universities
NOTE
: Students in this program must complete all requirements within six terms (2 years) of continuous registration.
Admission Requirements for Masters
Applicants for admission must be graduates of a recognized university, college, or institute as well as show evidence of scholarly achievement. Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, degree students must have a four year bachelor's degree or its equivalent with at least second class standing (B) based on their last 20 half courses or equivalent.
For applicants from countries that follow a British-patterned grading system, please note:
Overall standings are normally reported in lieu of an average. The CGPA can be determined on the basis of annual or overall standings as reported on the transcript or degree certificate.
A minimum grade of B, or Second Class, Upper Division, is required.
The National Diploma and Higher National Diploma are not recognized for admission to a graduate-level program.
Be sure to include a copy of your institution grading scale when uploading your transcripts.
If in doubt, you may wish to order a WES International Credential Advantage (iCap) report from wes.org
An applicant holding a degree other than one in the discipline area to which admission is sought will be considered on the basis of courses taken and academic standing.
Meeting the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission. No candidate will be admitted unless the academic unit recommends admission. All applicants will be advised by the Office of Graduate Studies in writing of their admission status.
