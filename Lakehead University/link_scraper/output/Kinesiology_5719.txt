Kinesiology
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
As a student in our School of Kinesiology you will study the science of human movement, physical activity, and their relationship to health, well-being and performance. Our multidisciplinary Kinesiology programs explore how the body moves by studying:
Anatomy
Physiology
Biomechanics
Ergonomics
Musculo-skeletal Injuries
Motor Development and Control
Nutrition
Adaptive Physical Activity
Health, Wellness and Fitness
Additionally, you will learn about the psychological, sociological and cultural factors that influence physical activity in all populations. This breadth of study will teach you to work collaboratively as part of an interprofessional team to deliver the best quality of care in diverse healthcare settings.
Our balance of in-class and hands-on courses will provide you with the experience necessary to assess movement across the lifespan.
If you are interested in becoming a Registered Kinesiologist, our broad-based learning curriculum successfully prepares you to challenge the registration exam for the regulatory college license requirements to practice in Ontario.
The Lakehead Advantage
You will gain hands-on assessment experience from day one through a series of applied, lab-based courses and through our Practice of Kinesiology applied courses. Multiple small lab sections allow for considerable one-on-one time with professors and fellow students.
We have academic advisors exclusively for the School of Kinesiology who are available to all students at any point during the year. It is our goal to ensure you receive the guidance and mentorship necessary to achieve the utmost success with your undergraduate degree and beyond.
We are one of few Kinesiology programs in Canada with a formalized co-operative program for our undergraduate students. Applications are due before Christmas break in second year. Successful applicants are required to complete a minimum of 4 four month paid work terms.   Following successful completion of the work terms students will return to complete the final academic year in the program.. This practical experience gives you a competitive edge when entering the workforce or pursuing professional certifications.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
Did you know, that it's also possible to transfer from your Kinesiology degree to a college diploma program such as Confederation College's Paramedic and Medical Radiation Technology programs? For more information, contact

First year Kinesiology studies set the stage for higher level courses such as:
Psychology of Physical Activity
Sociology of Physical Activity and Sport
Musculoskeletal Injuries
Exercise Prescription
Exercise Physiology
Human Anatomy
Electives are available each year to explore other topics outside of Kinesiology.
Fourth year Kinesiology students, under the guidance of a faculty member, complete a compulsory research project applying both theory and practice-based knowledge.
This project is an exceptional exercise in team building and leadership development and serves as a great foundation for those interested in pursuing graduate studies, research opportunities, or entering practice.
Our hands-on labs are specially designed to teach you how to interact with patients/clients, assess their physical movement and make recommendations for improving function. Cardio-pulmonary, movement analysis and materials testing technology provides enhanced experiential learning opportunities.
Labs are intentionally small in size, approximately 20 to 25 people, to facilitate hands-on participation and mentorship opportunities.
