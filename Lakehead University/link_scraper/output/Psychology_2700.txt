Tuition & Fees
Psychologists share a desire to make a positive contribution to human welfare through understanding and influencing the thoughts, emotions, and behaviour of individuals. They are concerned with what motivates us, what social, physical, and biological factors affect us, and what makes us unique.
Our multidisciplinary approach to Psychology provides you with the opportunity to explore these topics and the inner workings of the brain through either an Arts or Science stream, depending on your academic interests. Whichever stream you choose, you will graduate with the objective tools to develop theories, test them through scientific experimentation, and develop new knowledge through comprehensive research methods.
The breadth of study within our Psychology program is what sets Lakehead University apart. Throughout your undergraduate degree, you will gain at least one credit of exposure to all elements of the disciplines and sub-fields including Biological, Cognitive-Affective, Individual, Social, Abnormal, and Developmental, in addition to your stream electives.
We believe flexibility in your studies equates to flexibility in your career path. Our Psychology major can be paired with other majors including Gerontology, Philosophy, Women's Studies, and Education, to explore the intersection of these fields.
Much of our faculty are practicing clinical psychologists with a range of expertise and connections, making it possible to immerse students in research and volunteer opportunities from first year onward.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.

–
Introductory Psychology
This course touches on each core area of the discipline to familiarize you with Psychology in general and hopefully introduce you to a topic you would like to explore further.
Within the Arts stream, the balance of your courses must be within the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities. If you are pursuing the Science stream, the balance of your courses will fall under the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies.
You may earn up to six bonus points to add to your final Introductory Psychology grade by participating in research, or by writing a one page, double-spaced, summary of a Psychology article (1% per 1 hour of research participation or research summary) or a combination of the two. We encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity as it will expand your understanding of the discipline while boosting your final grade.

xperiments available for credit
are constantly updated throughout the year.
Undergraduate Research
As Canada's #1 Undergraduate Research University, we make research in your undergraduate years a reality. Our faculty members are experts and active researchers in their areas of study, including:
Addictions
Eating Disorders
Depression
You will also have the opportunity to participate in research projects starting in first year, allowing you to get a glimpse into the professional application of Psychology very early on.
Student Clubs & Organizations
We have two student associations open to Psychology students: the Psychology Association for Lakehead Students (PALS) and Psi Chi. PALS hosts workshops, mentorship opportunities, networking events, and presentations throughout the year to engage students both on-campus and in the field of study.
Our
Psi Chi chapter
is part of an internationally recognized honours society. Members must have a GPA in the top 35% of their class across the university, and minimum 3.0 GPA average for psychology courses.
Hands-On Courses
Beginning in second year, you may choose to take Research Opportunity and/or Directed Reading courses under the guidance of a Psychology professor. These courses are intended to enhance your in-class, theoretical learning with hands-on experience in a subfield. This experience provides significant professional advantages whether you plan to focus on research or clinical studies after graduation.
