Lakehead Advantage
Our Faculty of Social Science & Humanities is small and comprehensive, creating ample opportunity to access professors and teaching assistants and benefit from the intimate and interactive learning environment. We are very invested in your success. We enjoy helping you find your passion as a student, and shape your future as a prospective graduate.
Our faculty members are very involved in research at a national and international level. As a General Arts student you will have many opportunities to participate in research on various topics, depending on your particular area of interest. These opportunities may include summer work positions and seminar and/or directed reading courses.
We also offer the ability to do a joint BA degree with a Bachelor of Education (BEd) in Native Education at the Primary, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior levels. This is particularly beneficial if you wish to teach in Northwestern Ontario.
