Lakehead University offers an innovative Master of Social Work (MSW) degree at both campuses in the cities of Orillia and Thunder Bay. The School of Social Work established the MSW program to train advanced generalist social workers for practice with individuals, families, communities, and organizations in contexts, from major urban centres to northern, and rural areas. Our smaller campuses and approachable faculty provide a welcoming learning environment.
The curriculum focuses on the knowledge, values, and skills necessary for professional practice in environments characterized by urban regional centres, rural and remote communities, large geographic distances, low population density, diverse First Nations communities and people, and a mix of formal services.
Lakehead's MSW program emphasizes advanced professional practice, which is normally obtained by completing the
project track
.Â All students will be accepted into a project track. Early in their program,
AFTER consultation with their faculty supervisors
, students who prefer the
thesis track
may request a change from the Graduate Coordinator.
The MSW program structure allows for specialized and highly individualized student learning. Each student selects a field of practice around which to focus his or her course work, field practicum and project or thesis. Potential areas for student specialization relate to faculty members' expertise and include (but are not limited to) the following:
child welfare, mental health, juvenile justice, employment and income security, school social work, gerontology, and gender and women's studies.
MSW: Gender and Women's Studies Specialization
The Department of Gender and Women's Studies at Lakehead University is dedicated to furthering an understanding of the importance of gender as a category of analysis in scholarly inquiry. Through interdisciplinary instruction, students will critically assess the relevance of existing models of knowledge in reflecting gendered experience and scholarship.
The aim of the program is to encourage the development and integration of gendered teaching, learning, and research within the university community and the community at large. This Collaborative Master's program allows students to combine advanced disciplinary research with gendered scholarship from the interdisciplinary field of Gender and Women's Studies. Upon completion of the program, the degree awarded specifies the discipline of the participating academic unit and notes the Specialization in Gender and Women's Studies.
For additional information on the Interdisciplinary Graduate Specialization in Gender and Women's Studies, please
visit the Gender and Women's Studies website
. This specialization is only available at the Thunder Bay campus.
MSW: Gerontology Specialization
The Gerontology Program collaborates with five departments including Social Work, to provide students with an innovative, interdisciplinary learning perspective. Students have the opportunity to access multifaceted resources and work together with complementary disciplines.
Research and theory in Gerontology is reviewed, and the thesis or major project taken in the collaborating academic unit will have a gerontological focus.
