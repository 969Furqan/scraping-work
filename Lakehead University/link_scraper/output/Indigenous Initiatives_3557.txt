Tuition & Fees
Keewatinase offers students with Indigenous ancestry unique opportunities to become a teacher in a supportive environment. We offer programs for students interested in teaching primary/junior grades, intermediate/senior grades, or Native Language as a Second Language in primary and senior grades in Ontario. Our programs combine in-class learning with experiential community-based learning opportunities to develop the knowledge and skills to teach Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. Keewatinase works closely with each student on their educational journey to become a professional teacher certified by the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT).
Teach JK to Grade-6 (HBEd)
The Honours Bachelor of Education (Indigenous Teacher Education) Primary/Junior Division program provides individuals of Indigenous ancestry with the teaching strategies and knowledge necessary as a future teacher. We use a mixture of in-class and experiential learning to develop the skills and ability to teach Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at the Primary and Junior level. Our HBEd program helps prepare future teachers to meet the educational needs of elementary students while addressing elements of Indigenous heritage, identity, and languages. Graduates of the program are recommended to the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) for certification to teach in Ontario schools.
Teach Grades 7-12 (BA/BEd)
The Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Education (Indigenous Learning Major) Intermediate/Senior Division program provides individuals of Indigenous ancestry with teaching strategies and knowledge as a future teacher. We use a mixture of in-class and experiential learning to develop the skills and abilities to teach Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at the Intermediate/Senior grade levels (7-12). Our BA/BEd program helps prepare future teachers to meet the educational needs of intermediate and senior students while addressing elements of Indigenous heritage, identity, and language.
Teach Indigenous Languages (ILTD)
The Indigenous Language Teacher Diploma (ILTD) program provides fluent speakers of Algonquian languages (Ojibwe, Cree, Oji-Cree) with the skills and credentials to teach Native Language as a Second Language in primary/secondary schools in Ontario. Upon successful completion of the ILTD program students will be recommended to the Ontario College of Teachers.
