Next Step
Students benefit from close working relationships with their advisors. These relationships help to facilitate students' research in Condensed Matter & Optical Physics (semiconductor, surface science, soft-condensed matter, and fibre optics). Our collaboration with the medical physics staff at the
Regional Cancer Centre
also provides a number of applicable research opportunities with Medical Physics professionals.
As well as the regular core courses, students are provided with special topics courses. This combination of general and thesis specific courses prepares students for further graduate work and provides a solid background in their area of specialization.
MSc Physics Co-operative Program Option
Students enrolled in the MSc (Physics) program may take the Co-operative option subject to the approval of the Department. To obtain the MSc (Physics Co-operative Option) degree the student must satisfy all the academic requirements for the MSc (Physics) degree and in addition must complete Physics 5990 and 5992 successfully. The first and last terms of the student's program must be academic, and at least one of the work-terms must occur in a fall or winter session. The student may have the opportunity to work on a thesis during work-term placements.
For more details regarding the co-operative program option, please visit
Student Success Centre

Admission Requirements for Masters
Applicants for admission must be graduates of a recognized university, college, or institute as well as show evidence of scholarly achievement. Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, degree students must have a four year bachelor's degree or its equivalent with at least second class standing (B) based on their last 20 half courses or equivalent.
For applicants from countries that follow a British-patterned grading system, please note:
Overall standings are normally reported in lieu of an average. The CGPA can be determined on the basis of annual or overall standings as reported on the transcript or degree certificate.
A minimum grade of B, or Second Class, Upper Division, is required.
The National Diploma and Higher National Diploma are not recognized for admission to a graduate-level program.
Be sure to include a copy of your institution grading scale when uploading your transcripts.
If in doubt, you may wish to order a WES International Credential Advantage (iCap) report from wes.org
An applicant holding a degree other than one in the discipline area to which admission is sought will be considered on the basis of courses taken and academic standing.
Meeting the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission. No candidate will be admitted unless the academic unit recommends admission. All applicants will be advised by the Office of Graduate Studies in writing of their admission status.
