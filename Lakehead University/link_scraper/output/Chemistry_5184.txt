Chemistry
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Chemistry is often referred to as the "central science" as it focuses on the behaviour of matter and the basic substance of which all matter is composed. From harnessing Earth's mineral resources, to developing cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, the value and application of chemistry is unparalleled.
As a Chemistry student, you will have the opportunity to explore various areas within the discipline, such as:
Analytical Chemistry
Biochemistry
Inorganic Chemistry
Medical Chemistry
Organic Chemistry
Polymer Chemistry
Physical Chemistry
Theoretical Chemistry
Our Department of Chemistry is well-equipped for both teaching and research, with small class sizes to ensure you have the support necessary to succeed. In addition to faculty expertise, you will have access to a number of modern research instruments housed in our advanced facilities including the
Lakehead University Instrumentation Lab
.
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of Chemistry, we encourage you to pursue your interests in the field and the other core sciences. In addition to your Chemistry degree, you may combine your studies with a degree in Biology and/or Education, or a Specialization in Medical Sciences.
The Lakehead Advantage
Our small class sizes will allow you to interact with professors in both lecture and research settings. Many of our faculty members hire undergraduate students as research assistants each summer. This is a great opportunity to participate in cutting-edge scientific exploration and gain experience in the field, giving you a professional advantage post-graduation. For faculty research areas, please visit our
Faculty Listing
.
Shared instrumentation facilities have created excellent opportunities for cross-disciplinary research.  Our department often collaborates with faculty from the other science departments, resulting in the advancement of knowledge from a variety of perspectives. Unlike other universities, you will be trained in the operation of lab equipment to gather and analyze your own data rather than passing it on to a technician.
Transfer Options
It’s easy to transfer to Lakehead.
Our pathway and general transfer policies are designed to help you maximize your credits from your current or previous studies at either college or university – or even both.
There are a number of ways to transfer to Lakehead. Let us help you achieve your degree completion goals. For more information regarding specific admission requirements from college or university, check out the “Admissions Requirement” tab above and select your most recent level of study.
Applying to Lakehead University is easy and we are here to help you along the way.
