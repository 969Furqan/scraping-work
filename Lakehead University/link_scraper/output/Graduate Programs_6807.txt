How to Apply
Next Step
The PhD in Chemistry and Materials Science is a research-intensive graduate program focused on the intellectual development and advanced training of scientists in two fields of specialization:
Physical Chemistry
, the study of physical principles which govern the behaviour and properties of chemical systems; and
Molecular and Materials Science
, the synthesis and characterization of novel compounds and materials.
NOTE
: Students in this program are expected to complete all requirements within a minimum of nine terms (3 years) to a maximum of twelve terms (4 years) of continuous full-time registration. Candidates must meet a minimum residency of three terms, two of which must be consecutive.

Chemistry and Materials Science PhD program pages
.
Admission Requirements for PhD
Applicants for admission must be graduates of a recognized university and show evidence of scholarly achievement. Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, students must have a Masters degree or its equivalent with an academic average as specified by the academic unit. An applicant holding a degree other than one in the discipline area to which admission is sought will be considered on the basis of Master's courses taken and academic standing.
Meeting the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission. No candidate will be admitted unless the academic unit recommends admission. All applicants will be advised in writing by the Office of Graduate Studies of their admission status.
