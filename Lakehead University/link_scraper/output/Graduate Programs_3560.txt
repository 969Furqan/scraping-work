Overview
Please Note:
The application deadline is February 1st for international applicants. Only complete applications (including references) will be reviewed.
The Department of Sociology offers a graduate program dedicated to enhancing students' knowledge of the societies in which they live, while increasing their ability to think independently and critically about important social issues.
We now offer a course-based graduate program in Sociology. The course-based streams are available in the general program as well as in our three specializations. Students may apply to enter the thesis stream after completion of the first semester.
MA in Sociology: Gender and Women's Studies Specialization - Fall Intake Only
The Department of Gender and Women's Studies at Lakehead University is dedicated to furthering an understanding of the importance of gender as a category of analysis in scholarly inquiry. Through interdisciplinary instruction, students will critically assess the relevance of existing models of knowledge in reflecting gendered experience and scholarship.
The aim of the program is to encourage the development and integration of gendered teaching, learning, and research within the university community and the community at large.  This Collaborative Master's program allows students to combine advanced disciplinary research with gendered scholarship from the interdisciplinary field of Gender and Women's Studies.  Upon completion of the program, the degree awarded specifies the discipline of the participating academic unit and notes the Specialization in Gender and Women's Studies.
For additional information on the Interdisciplinary Graduate Specialization in Gender and Women's Studies, please
visit the Gender and Women's Studies website

MA in Sociology: Gerontology Specialization - Fall Intake Only
The Gerontology Program collaborates with five departments including Sociology, to provide students with an innovative, interdisciplinary learning perspective. Students have the opportunity to access multifaceted resources and work together with complementary disciplines.
Research and theory in Gerontology is reviewed, and the thesis or major project taken in the collaborating academic unit will have a gerontological focus.
For additional information on the Interdisciplinary Graduate Specialization in Gerontology, please

MA in Sociology: Social Justice Studies Specialization
The Social Justice Studies specialization enables students to conduct original research on social justice issues by drawing on the disciplinary tools provided by Sociology. Students may investigate any topic relevant to social justice studies, by utilizing appropriate theoretical frameworks and research methodologies from Sociology. While a strong foundation in Sociology is emphasized, interdisciplinary work, public engagement, and community activism are also encouraged where appropriate.
For additional information on the Interdisciplinary Graduate Specialization in Social Justice Studies,  please review the MA Sociology (Social Justice Studies)
