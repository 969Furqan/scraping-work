Studies leading to the degree of Master of Science in Geology normally emphasize the fields of Petrochemistry and Tectonophysics.
Petrochemistry is deemed to include: Field and laboratory studies of ore deposits, igneous, metamorphic, and lithified sedimentary rocks. Tectonophysics is deemed to include: Field and laboratory studies of structural geology, rock magnetism, and basin analysis.
The department has specializations in the broad areas of petrochemistry and tectonophysics which have included projects in:
petrology, mineralogy, geochemistry, structural geology, strain analysis, mapping, tectonics, sedimentation, economic geology, paleomagnetism and experimental rock deformation and strength testing.
At least 30% of our MSc students proceed to PhD studies and most have published their research in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Fieldwork has taken place in all parts of Canada, including the high Arctic as well as overseas, e.g., in Cyprus. For a complete list of potential MSc Geology projects, recently completed theses, faculty members and their area of expertise, please visit the
