Next Step
In the Master of Public Health program, students will focus on current issues in the science and/or service of public health, so that they may gain experience through opportunities in any of the fundamental disciplines that underlie public health. The program is primarily intended to prepare graduates for a career in public health practice. The program's objectives are to prepare a graduate who:
possesses advanced health-related education
is capable of critical analysis
understands health-related decision-making at the level of the individual, population, and government
understands research
possesses knowledge exchange and dissemination strategies for individuals, populations, and government
Lakehead's MPH program is primarily intended to build on the knowledge foundation of persons working in the field of Public Health.
Applicants with a background in Dentistry, Veterinary Sciences, Bachelor of Surgery/Medicine and Pharmacy do not meet our eligibility requirements and will be refused
.
Master of Public Health
programs may be completed through Distance Education on a
Flexible full-time or Full-time basis
. Those wishing to complete the Master of Public Health program on-campus
may apply to the full-time on-campus program
. Note that, once admitted to the Master of Public Health program, students are not permitted to change from the Standard Full-time Option to the Flexible Full-time Option, and vice versa.
Full-time students completing at a distance must attend the daytime classes
For those studying at a distance (flexible full-time basis), the Master of Public Health courses are offered using a combination of Zoom videoconferencing technology for real-time scheduled classes, and of Desire2Learn (D2L), a secure password-protected learning environment (e.g., for course resources, e-mail, and online discussions). The connectivity using Zoom allows students to have direct audio and visual contact with the course instructor and with other graduate students during class time and while working together on shared course assignments. In some classes, break-out sessions are structured into the course so that students have both large-and small-group learning experiences.

Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, degree students must have a four year bachelor's degree or its equivalent with at least second class standing (B) based on their last 20 half courses or equivalent.
For applicants from countries that follow a British-patterned grading system, please note:
Overall standings are normally reported in lieu of an average. The CGPA can be determined on the basis of annual or overall standings as reported on the transcript or degree certificate.
A minimum grade of B, or Second Class, Upper Division, is required.
The National Diploma and Higher National Diploma are not recognized for admission to a graduate-level program.

Conditions of Graduate Awards

are based on academic merit.
