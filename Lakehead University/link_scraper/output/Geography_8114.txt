Geography
Welcome
Admission Requirements
First Year at a Glance
Enrich Your Education
Tuition & Fees
Geography is the study of spatial patterns and processes on Earth's surface and the relationship between society, populations and the environment. Our Geography programs focus on physical geography, dealing with spatial aspects of land, water and the atmosphere, as well as human geography which explores the cultural, political and economic forces behind the distribution of human activities.
As a Geography student you will spend the first two years building a foundation of knowledge in a wide spectrum of geographical themes which examine:
Where populations and activities are located on Earth
When and why physical and environmental patterns change
The impacts these changes have on human and physical environments
The responses to these impacts
In your final two years of study you may specialize in a particular area including:
Climate change
Glacial Processes
Soil Analysis
Conservation
Natural Hazards
Water Resource Management
Sociocultural Geography
Our courses reflect the breadth of the discipline, as well as geographical techniques and research methods including digital photogrammetry, remote sensing, soil and water testing and geographic information systems (GIS).
We also offer regional field camps and a Regional or International Field Study course that is available in your final year of study.
Lakehead Advantage
In addition to your Geography degree, we offer a concurrent
Certificate in Geomatics
which includes the study of cartography, air photo interpretation, digital photogrammetry and more applied mapping techniques. You will also have access to specialized equipment at the
Lakehead University GeoSpatial Data Centre
to support your studies. This certificate is a great addition to your degree, providing you with practical skills and an employment advantage post-graduation.
Our location in the heart of Northwestern Ontario, surrounded by Lake Superior, the boreal forest and other unique geographical features, makes Lakehead University the ideal institution to learn about Geography. We maintain great relationships with regional organizations dedicated to outdoor education and the environment, facilitating experiential learning and fieldwork opportunities in one of the most beautiful and diverse landscapes Canada has to offer.
Our International Field Study course is open to you as a third or fourth year student and is a unique opportunity to conduct structured and supervised geographical fieldwork. You will work with professors, local geographers and other experts to explore the physical attributes of your destination and gain insight into how diverse the Earth's geography really is. This course is a great opportunity to learn applied geographical methods, network within the industry and expand your knowledge of the Earth's features.
