Next Step
The field of Chemical Engineering serves a wide range of industrial sectors, including petroleum, pulp
and paper, bio-refining, cement, pharmaceuticals, and waste treatment. The PhD program in Chemical
Engineering has been designed to meet the needs of these sectors through a comprehensive study
program. Our PhD program in Chemical Engineering is open to graduates from the current Master's in
Chemical Engineering program at Lakehead University, as well as exceptional graduates of chemical
engineering or related programs from across the country and around the world.
The program aims to provide students with a solid basis for careers in chemical engineering in
academia and industry. This will be achieved through a combination of coursework, independent
research study, and seminars in which the students are encouraged to think independently, collaborate
with other researchers, and innovate to solve practical problems and developments in industry.
We have two fundamental differences from other Engineering PhD programs.
The chemical engineering program has both written and oral comprehensive exams.
The chemical engineering program has a progress report..
Admission Requirements for PhD
Applicants for admission must be graduates of a recognized university and show evidence of scholarly achievement. Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, students must have a Masters degree or its equivalent with an academic average as specified by the academic unit. An applicant holding a degree other than one in the discipline area to which admission is sought will be considered on the basis of Master's courses taken and academic standing.
Meeting the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission. No candidate will be admitted unless the academic unit recommends admission. All applicants will be advised in writing by the Office of Graduate Studies of their admission status.
