Admission Requirements for Masters
Applicants for admission must be graduates of a recognized university, college, or institute as well as show evidence of scholarly achievement. Except where otherwise stated in the Admission Requirements of a particular program, degree students must have a four year bachelor's degree or its equivalent with at least second class standing (B) based on their last 20 half courses or equivalent.
For applicants from countries that follow a British-patterned grading system, please note:
Overall standings are normally reported in lieu of an average. The CGPA can be determined on the basis of annual or overall standings as reported on the transcript or degree certificate.
A minimum grade of B, or Second Class, Upper Division, is required.
The National Diploma and Higher National Diploma are not recognized for admission to a graduate-level program.
Be sure to include a copy of your institution grading scale when uploading your transcripts.
If in doubt, you may wish to order a WES International Credential Advantage (iCap) report from wes.org
An applicant holding a degree other than one in the discipline area to which admission is sought will be considered on the basis of courses taken and academic standing.
Meeting the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission. No candidate will be admitted unless the academic unit recommends admission. All applicants will be advised by the Office of Graduate Studies in writing of their admission status.

Program Specific Requirements
In addition to the general admission requirements for Master programs,
the following requirements also apply
:
To ensure an adequate understanding of the core elements of forestry, applicants holding a four-year degree of adequate standing (i.e., B or better) in an allied discipline (e.g., Biology, Geography, Agriculture, Environmental Studies, Resource Management, Outdoor Recreation) may be required to take up to two full-course equivalents at the undergraduate level. This requirement is additional to the graduate courses of the chosen program. Upon admission, the student's supervisor prepares a proposal for fulfilling the allied-discipline requirement, based on the student's undergraduate courses already taken, and submits it to the Forestry Graduate Studies Committee for approval
An applicant with inadequate academic background or standing may be invited to take four full-course equivalents (minimum) in forestry at the undergraduate level. If performance in these courses averages B or better, the applicant may then apply for admission to one of the graduate program
