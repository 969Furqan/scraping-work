Otherwise, formal work period assignments do not begin until winter term of third year.
Co-op Placement
During your undergrad you will have the opportunity to participate in our
co-operative education program
to gain rewarding experiences in the industry, acquire practical skills and earn an income to finance your education. We have placed over 700 students with industry partners including IBM, Environment Canada, RIM, Atomic Energy of Canada, the Canadian Grain Commission, CIBC and more.
Student Mentorship
We have a full-time faculty member who is dedicated to mentoring first and second year students’ programming skills. This resource is particularly useful if you have limited experience in computer programming and would like one-on-one time with an expert in the field outside of your class and lab time.
Specialization
We offer a unique Game Programming Specialization to all Computer Science majors. This specialization teaches you the intricacies of animation, two and three dimensional graphics, gameplay and much more while you develop single, multiplayer and mobile games.
Accessible Faculty
Our department is small enough to provide you with direct access to the professors, and individual access to advanced computing equipment. Our faculty is active in its research, and committed to balancing theoretical information with hands-on opportunities. Projects and research papers are regularly integrated into our undergraduate courses.
