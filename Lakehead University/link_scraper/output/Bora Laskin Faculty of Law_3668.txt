Law
Welcome
Tuition & Fees
Welcome to the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law!
Our three-year law degree (JD) focuses on three mandates:
Aboriginal and Indigenous Law
Natural Resources and Environmental Law
Sole/Small Town Practice with the Integrated Practice Curriculum (IPC)
We blend the study of legal doctrine with the hands-on learning of practical skills. Unlike other law schools, our law graduates are exempted from the articling requirement as a result of the integrated practical skills in all three years of our legal program. Law graduates may immediately sit for the bar exams and enter the legal profession practice-ready.
The Bora Laskin Faculty of Law was a collaborative effort in Thunder Bay to serve the northern Ontario region and providing access to justice in our region.
We are a small community law school with class sizes that allow students and faculty members to get to know each other.
