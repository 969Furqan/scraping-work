Introduction to Interior Decorating
Overview
This course will cover the basic principles and elements of design, the importance of room decor, and the major categories of style types. We will review the types of career options in the field of design, the components of a professional portfolio, and client needs assessments. Basic knowledge of floor plans, window treatments, lighting, colour schemes, and styles will be examined and implemented in a colour board presentation at the culmination of the course. This will become the first addition to your portfolio.
