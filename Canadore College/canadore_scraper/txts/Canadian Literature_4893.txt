Canadian Literature
Overview
This course will allow students to read selected Canadian literature, including novels and short stories, and to analyse and discuss various key points of each piece of literature.

Some suggested areas of study for each novel will include selected key literary terms as well as discussion of the relevance of setting and plot in relation to Canadian culture and history, found in each individual piece. This course will focus on both reading literature as well as the use of proper written English. The novels chosen will also be explored in relation to their relevance to Canadian culture. Key literary terms and events will be discussed for each novel, including questions for each literary piece.
