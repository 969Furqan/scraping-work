Global Citizenship (degree-level advanced)
Overview
Informed citizens in today’s world appreciate the meaning of civic life at the local, national and global level. Students reflect on and develop a personal awareness of the meaning of freedoms, rights and obligations in a diverse global community and consider the political, social and economic drivers that influence patterns of human behaviour and the health of the planet. Based on general principles of global citizenship, students look beyond national borders to assess personal responsibilities related to the health and well-being of the planet and inhabitants. Students critically evaluate information related to environmental and social health, equipped with attitudes and behaviours that foster global environmental and social responsibility.
