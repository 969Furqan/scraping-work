This course is intended to provide the students with math basics as applicable to the operation of water and wastewater systems. The basic concepts in unit conversions, area, volume calculations, and density are discussed first. Based on this students are introduced to the use of math to understand chemistry math under the topics of concentration, feed solutions, liquid chemicals, molarity, normality and organic loading. The main objective of the course is to lay a sound foundation in math and chemistry concepts as required to understand and apply to the operation of water and wastewater systems.
