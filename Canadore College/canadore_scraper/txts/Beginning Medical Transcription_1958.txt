Beginning Medical Transcription
Overview
This is a beginning medical transcription course designed to provide students with a working knowledge of transcription of medical reports. Transcription is taking the spoken word and turning it into a written document. Case studies are provided so that the student will gain knowledge in the transcribing of various medical reports. Medical reports will be transcribed from ten individual case studies, each of which concerns an inpatient with a specific medical problem. There are between four and eight reports within each case study. Students will be involved in the care of the patient from the date of admission through the date of discharge. Students must complete specified prerequisites.
