Business of Tomorrow
Overview
There are two great pressures on manufacturing today; both related to change. One is the geo-political, or global economy, the other is the expectations placed on each of us, as individuals, to cope with a very different workforce and a very dynamic workplace. This material covers the information that will help the supervisor deal with these issues and answer the questions that arise daily in the workplace. The course includes implementing change, the impacts from global competitors, understanding the mosaic workforce, committing to continuously learning and helping others to do the same.
