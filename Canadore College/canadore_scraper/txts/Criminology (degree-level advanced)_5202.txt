Criminology (degree-level advanced)
Overview
The interdisciplinary study of social science examining the individual and social aspects of crime is known as criminology. Students work through an introduction to the social science perspective on crime. Presentations, discussions, and assignments allow students to investigate the various theoretical positions related to crime and criminal behaviour. Working forward from the types and definitions of crime, students trace some of the links between government policy and the impacts of these policies on both society and the individual.
