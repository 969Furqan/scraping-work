Geographic Information Systems Certificate Program
Overview
A geographic information system (GIS) is a system for capturing, storing, analyzing, and managing data and associated attributes that are spatially referenced to the earth. It allows users to create interactive queries, analyze the spatial information, edit data and maps, and present the results of all these operations. GIS technology can be used for scientific investigation, resource management, asset management, environmental impact assessment, urban planning, cartography, criminology, history, sales, marketing, and route planning.
Note:
Students have up to 7 years to complete all requirements.
