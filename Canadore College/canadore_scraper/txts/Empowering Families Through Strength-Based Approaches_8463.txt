Empowering Families Through Strength-Based Approaches
Overview
This course emphasizes the reciprocal partnership between the families of children living with diverse abilities and the service team within the community. Students will examine the structural, cultural, and developmental diversities of families in order to empower them as the primary support for their children’s learning and development. Working in collaboration with the family and the service team, students will demonstrate strategies that engage in family-centred and strength-based decision making regarding the learning and development of the child. In addition, students will research community resources and learn to make referrals and advise families.
Prerequisite(s):
CN-ERC015 Evidence-Informed Decision-Making and CN-ERC025 Field Placement I (ECE Resource Consulting)

Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes represent culminating demonstrations of learning and achievement. In addition, learning outcomes are interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolation of one another. As such, they should be viewed as a comprehensive whole. They describe performances that demonstrate that significant integrated learning by graduates of the program has been achieved.
