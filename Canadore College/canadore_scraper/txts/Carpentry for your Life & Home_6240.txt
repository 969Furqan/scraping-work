Carpentry for your Life & Home
Overview
Carpentry is not just for construction workers; it is for anyone who believes they can do it themselves. Do you want to take care of your own house? Do you own basic maintenance and upkeep? How about building your own project like the shelves, racks or benches you see online? Do you want to know what different hand tools are for, or not be afraid of power tools anymore? This course will help you begin all of that. It will introduce basic theory, like how to measure, tally materials, or determine square and plumb. It will get you started with the most common hand tools, and teach you how to use power tools, like the table saw, confidently and safely. You will learn about some of the common tasks of household care - like re-caulking a bathroom or hanging a heavy picture or shelf - and will plan and complete a project of your own choosing (project materials cost not included). A great first step to building the carpentry skills you need for your life.
