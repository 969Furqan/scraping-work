The Legalization of Cannabis in Canada
Overview
After a prohibition that has been in place for almost 100 years, the Canadian government legalized the recreational use of cannabis in 2018. This makes Canada only the second country in the world (behind Uruguay) to do so at a national level. Students will examine the history of cannabis within Canada, develop insights into the factors behind the decision to legalize, discuss Bill C-45 and the Cannabis Regulations, and explore the emerging and dynamic infrastructure surrounding the legal recreational use of cannabis. Note: You must be 19 years of age or older to take this course. There will be no exceptions to this requirement (this is a 7 week course)
