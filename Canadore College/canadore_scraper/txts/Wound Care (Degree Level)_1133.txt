Wound Care (Degree Level)
Overview
Leaders in health care recognize the importance of skilled care providers in the early identification of skin and wound related pathophysiology. All levels of care providers play an important integrative role. Students gain a basic knowledge of overall skin health and prevention strategies for identifying those people at risk of common wounds. Interventions for holistic care planning need to augment wound healing including prevention of reoccurrence and healthy skin maintenance. Students will develop skills to identify wounds and their ability to heal or non-healable wounds along with expected healing rates. These skills will apply the evidence-based framework (scientific studies, expert knowledge and patient preference) from Wound Bed Preparation. Common wound types include pressure injuries, leg ulcers (vascular and other causes), diabetic and other foot wounds (including neuropathic, ischemic or combination).
