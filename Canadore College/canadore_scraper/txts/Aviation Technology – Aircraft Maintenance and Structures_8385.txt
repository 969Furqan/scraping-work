Note:
(i) This program has been designed to enable students to enhance their education and build upon their aircraft maintenance skills with an additional specification in Structures. The first two years of the program are common with the Aviation Technician- Aircraft Maintenance program. Transfer opportunities exist for graduates of a Transport Canada accredited school who have met the applicable requirements of STD566.10. (ii) Successful completion of these programs will result in 24 months accreditation toward an Aircraft Maintenance Engineering (AME) Category M Licence or 12 months towards Category S. These are the first programs of their kind in Ontario and first in Canada to be eligible for the full 24-month accreditation granted by Transport Canada. Class attendance is mandatory.
Graduates from other Transport Canada accredited aircraft maintenance programs may apply for advanced standing into the third year.
