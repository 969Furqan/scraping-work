Human Resources Certificate Program
Overview
The streamlining of many routine functions in human resources has created a growing need for highly trained professionals with the skills to plan, hire, train, manage, retain, and develop tomorrow’s workforce. Professionals in human resources management must be involved in the strategic planning process, handle legal and ethical issues, manage finances, serve as in-house consultants on organizational behaviour, and act as change managers. Our certificate in Human Resources Management provides a core of courses addressing the functional areas of human resources. Students may enrol in individual courses without applying for the certificate. This program can be completed in its entirety through distance learning.
