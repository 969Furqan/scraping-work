Anatomy and Physiology I
Overview
Anatomy and Physiology I examines the normal structure and function of the human adult. The course begins with an orientation to the human body, the levels of organization within the body and the inter-related and interdependence of body systems. The concepts of metabolism, fundamental physiological needs and homeostasis are introduced. All knowledge is then applied to the study of the integumentary, skeletal, muscle and the nervous systems. Learner preparation and learning activities are designed to promote critical thinking.
