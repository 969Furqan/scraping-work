Nephrology Nursing
Overview
The number of Canadians at risk for or living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise, due in part to the aging of the population and the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. Designed for RNs and RPNs, this program prepares you to deliver kidney care to affected patients across all stages of the kidney care journey, from early detection through dialysis, palliative care and transplant.
Gain the knowledge you need to promote and deliver competent, safe and ethical care to those at risk for developing, or affected by, the disease and/or insufficiency.
