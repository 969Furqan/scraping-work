Artificial Intelligence
Overview
This course explores the idea of artificial intelligence (A.I.) from three different perspectives: scientific, philosophical, and cultural. The scientific perspective provides insight as to how artificial intelligence technologies work, the current limitations, and supposed future potential. The philosophical perspective explores whether A.I. is good or bad, essential or dangerous, and what the future could hold. The cultural angle examines how society views A.I. and whether these views are accurate. Toward the end of the course deeper topics will be introduced including how A.I. compares to human intelligence, the singularity, and futurism.
