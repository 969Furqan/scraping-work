Pre-Health Math II
Overview
By the end of this course, students will have demonstrated the ability to evaluate a variety of algebraic expressions and apply these principles to typical problems that arise in the health care fields. Concepts studied include algebra, with an emphasis on analytical techniques; and evaluating systems of linear equations. Students will develop essential critical thinking and problem-solving skills through exposure to application problems, including concentrations and pH. Students will use numerical methods along with graphs, charts, and tables to effectively calculate the empirical and theoretical probability of simple events using key rules of probability and apply descriptive and inferential statistics to applications from the health care fields.
