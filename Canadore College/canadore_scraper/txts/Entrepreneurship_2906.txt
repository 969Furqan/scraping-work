Entrepreneurship
Overview
This course will cover a wide variety of topics for those interested in starting, or seeking employment in, a small business. The course will capture the entrepreneurial spirit, and students will get first-hand exposure to the benefits and drawbacks of starting a new business and being your own boss. Issues pervasive in small businesses such as spotting trends or taking advantage of niche business opportunities will be discussed and factored into class exercises. Students will have the opportunity to practice start-up skills through feasibility analysis, the idea pitch, defining markets, targeting customers, operations, and deciding on which type of business to start. The ability to maintain and sustain operations of a small business will be experienced with particular attention to budgeting, forecasting, and cash management. In this course, students will have an authentic opportunity to test their entrepreneurial skills through a real business venture.
Please Note
: Students will be required to invest approximately $50 into a personal business venture which will be used to complete the course assessments. This money will be invested directly by the student and will not be collected by the instructor or educational institution.
