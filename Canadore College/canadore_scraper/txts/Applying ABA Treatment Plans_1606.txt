Applying ABA Treatment Plans
Overview
This self paced course course provides students with foundational knowledge to support the application of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) treatment plans in their areas of practice. Students will learn how the science of ABA is used to build skills and reduce challenging behaviour. The role of the Board Certified Behaviour Analyst (BCBA) and the ways BCBA’s support treatment plan application are explored. Content is presented across four common domains: communication, social skills, daily living skills and behaviour reduction/self-regulation. Students will apply the concepts learned throughout the course via interactive exercises.
