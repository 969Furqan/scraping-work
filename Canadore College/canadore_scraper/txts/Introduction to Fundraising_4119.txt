Overview
Students gain an overview of the principles, ethics and practices of professional fundraising and a systemic examination of the critical thinking strategies and preparation that is required before an organization can engage in successful fundraising. Students examine the evolution of fundraising in North America, the role the voluntary sector plays in today’s society and the changing nature of the position of a fundraising professional.
