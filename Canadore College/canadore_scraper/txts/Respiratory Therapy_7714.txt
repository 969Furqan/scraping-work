The program has been designed to meet the core and clinical competencies of the Respiratory Therapy Entry to Practice National Competency Framework. These competencies are acquired through didactic and laboratory learning, clinical simulation and clinical practicum. The curriculum focuses on the development of assessment, analysis and critical thinking skills, which are integral to the role of a Respiratory Therapist. The program is accredited by Accreditation Canada.
The program and the profession involve working in an interactive team-based approach.  The Respiratory Therapist works in an area of moderate to high physical and psychological demands and requires a regular demand on sensory attention, as work activities require a need for sustained concentration.
The clinical practicum, year three, involves rotations in various clinical settings such as: wards, intensive care, pulmonary and cardiac diagnostics, pediatric/neonatal care, operating rooms and community care for a maximum of 34 weeks. Students must be prepared to relocate for completion of clinical practicum as most of the placement assignments are outside of the North Bay area.  All costs associated with clinical practicum, such as travel, parking and relocation/accommodations are the responsibility of the student. Students should expect to do combinations of 8-10 and 12-hour shifts inclusive of days, evenings, nights and weekends.
