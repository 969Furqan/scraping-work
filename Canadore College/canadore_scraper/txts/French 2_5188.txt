French 2
Overview
The student will sustain development of language skills by extending vocabulary with regard to all activities after work such as weekend chores, leisure, sports including holidaying abroad. The grammatical structures at this level continue to be simple. Through systematic exercises the student becomes more confident and moves on from level 1 present tense and near future to the past tense. The student at the end of this level will be able to share more extensively life at home as well as describe a real or imagined past holiday in a French speaking country.
