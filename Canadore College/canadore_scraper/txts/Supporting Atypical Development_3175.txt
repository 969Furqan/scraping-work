Supporting Atypical Development
Overview
This course introduces students to early learning pedagogy and play-based strategies as the cornerstones of supporting children with special needs. Through a lens of curriculum principles that guide inclusive early learning programs, students will examine and analyze developmental characteristics of children in order to recommend program adaptations and modifications that build on children’s strengths. In addition, students will utilize observation skills and screening tools in order to recommend centre policies and practices that promote meaningful and maximum early learning program participation.
