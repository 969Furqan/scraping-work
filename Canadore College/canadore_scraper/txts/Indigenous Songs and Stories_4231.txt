Indigenous Songs and Stories
Overview
This online course centers Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin – Anishinaabe Knowledge – by using Anishinaabe songs and stories to support learners in their journey of understanding fundamental concepts in relation to language revitalization and resurgence. The course begins by inquiring into the history of Anishinaabemowin (the Ojibwe language) and forming a beginner`s comprehension of introductory language skills in Anishinaabemowin. Learners will explore their role in maintaining the Anishinaabe stories and songs shared throughout the course. Learners will also build the capacity to engage with knowledge keepers and elders to support the ongoing resurgence of Anishinaabemowin within their respective fields.
