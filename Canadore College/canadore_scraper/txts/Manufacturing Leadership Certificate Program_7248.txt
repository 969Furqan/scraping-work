Manufacturing Leadership Certificate Program
Overview
The Manufacturing Leadership Certificate Program (MLCP) has been developed through a training partnership of five Ontario community colleges and the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters (CME). Global competition, the development of advanced technologies, and other economic challenges are rapidly changing the way Canadian business and industry operates. The purpose of this program is to assist supervisors to develop multifaceted leadership skills and deal with issues that are specific to the manufacturing environment. MLCP was developed for individuals working in a manufacturing environment and is designed to meet the needs of those recently promoted to the level of supervisor and/or those wishing to assume a supervisory role in the future.
