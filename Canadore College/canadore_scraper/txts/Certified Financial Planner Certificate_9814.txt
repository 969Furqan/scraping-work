Certified Financial Planner Certificate
Overview
The Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Program is designed to help financial planners achieve their goals. Financial planners learn the fundamentals of building a comprehensive financial plan and are recognized as dedicated professionals with the know-how to assist clients while adhering to high ethical standards. The CFP designation marks financial planners as qualified to practice as professionals. Upon completion of the four courses, students can register to complete the culminating exam in order to receive the CFP designation. Students pursuing the CFP designation will be required to write the CIFP comprehensive exam before writing the FP1 exam. To ensure they are sufficiently prepared for the CIFP comprehensive exam, they will be required to complete a series of online modules, free of charge, upon completion of the four courses. For further information of the CIFP visit their website at www.cipf.ca. All courses are offered through distance education/online learning.
