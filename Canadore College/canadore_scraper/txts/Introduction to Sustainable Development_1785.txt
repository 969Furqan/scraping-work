Introduction to Sustainable Development
Overview
This course introduces the concept of sustainable development to a broad audience. Students are presented with the factors that affect the environmental, economic and social sustainability of our communities. The course investigates the development of human populations and how their need for resources (e.g. energy, food, water) has compromised the natural ecosystems. Social and economic factors are explored in the context of social equality and sustainability in the local and global economy. The effects of individual lifestyle changes on the sustainability of communities are also examined. Students have the option to take this course in a Hybrid format (partially in class and partially online), or completely online.
