Mental Health Literacy
Overview
This course will introduce students to mental health literacy and its goals of recognizing and managing mental health concerns, strengthening mental health and well-being, and ending stigma. Focusing on the post-secondary student population, this course takes an intersectional approach and considers multiple and diverse perspectives on mental health and well-being in our changing world. Throughout the course, students will build a variety of skills and capacities that contribute to well-being at the individual level as well as at the community level. This course is not intended to be a substitute for counselling, and it does not qualify students to act as mental health professionals upon completion.
