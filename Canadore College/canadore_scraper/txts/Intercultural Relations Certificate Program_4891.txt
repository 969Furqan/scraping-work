Intercultural Relations Certificate Program
Overview
NEW! Globalization brings the people of the world closer together; however, discrimination and other forms of intolerance continue to cause problems. In our increasingly multicultural society these issues can lead to exclusion and inequality, often along racial and ethnic lines. Throughout the curriculum a number of topics will be explored including: diversity issues in a social context, critical differences in cross-cultural communication, and identifying the sources, causes, forms and manifestations of these issues in our society. This online program is a direct response to learning needs identified by a broad range of representatives from human services and justice agencies that recognize that racial inequity and negative stereotyping are significant social problems.
