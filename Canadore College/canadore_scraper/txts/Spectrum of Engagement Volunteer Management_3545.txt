Spectrum of Engagement Volunteer Management
Overview
In order to properly engage volunteers and manage a productive volunteer program you must recognize the process in which it operates. This course overlaps the Volunteer Engagement Cycle with the National Occupational Standards for managers of Volunteer Resources (HR Council for the Non-profit Sector). Learn how to apply the activity within the process of the cycle, analyse your demographics, and evaluate the impact on your volunteers and on the overall volunteer program. Volunteer Managers and great Volunteer Programs dont just happen; they are very strategically and methodically planned out. Discover the impact of your reputation on recruitment, and explore strategies for every facet of the volunteer cycle including pre-recruitment planning, supervision, performance evaluations, recognition, and risk management.
