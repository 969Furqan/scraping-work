Designer DNA: The Age of Genetic Advancement
Overview
Why don’t snakes have legs? How do we make seedless watermelons? Is violent behaviour genetic? Can we eradicate genetic disease? The answers to these questions lie in the study of genetics. Examples like these will be used to explore how our increasingly sophisticated understanding of genomes and the genetic basis of life have advanced areas such as cloning, genetic engineering, and genetic enhancement. The ethics of modern genetics will also be explored as advancements in this field impact both individual and society.
