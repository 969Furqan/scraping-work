Palliative Care (Badge)
Overview
Being able to provide compassionate palliative care is a skill that not all health care workers are able to have. Taking this 10 hour badge to further your knowledge and understanding about palliative care shows that you are committed and passionate about helping people live out their final days/weeks/years in a caring, respectful environment.
According to the World Health Organization
1
, palliative care is the improvement of a person’s quality of life as well as that of their family when they are faced with a life-threatening illness. The focus of palliative care is to improve the quality of life through supporting their psychological, physical, spiritual, social, and cognitive needs. This is accomplished through a team approach. This team will include physicians, nurses, support workers, social workers, physiotherapists, paramedics, and volunteers that are specially trained in palliative care. As, worldwide, only 14% of those that are palliative receive appropriate services it is important to have people like you trained in palliative care to allow for more people to have access to well-trained health care workers who can provide palliative care.
