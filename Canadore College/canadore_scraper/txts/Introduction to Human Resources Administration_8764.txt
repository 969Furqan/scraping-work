Introduction to Human Resources Administration
Overview
Specific focus is on the factors that affect the overall atmosphere in the workplace and that which contributes to an environment conducive to maximum productivity. Students will be introduced to effective strategies for hiring, motivating, managing, training, and retaining staff. Students will study the following topics: the strategic importance of Human Resources and the role of the HR Manager; competitive challenges facing Human Resources; job analysis and design; Human Resources planning; recruitment and selection; orientation and training; employee relations; performance management; compensation; employee benefits and services; labour relations; health and safety; equity and diversity; and international human resources management. Significant emphasis will be placed on the team approach to creative problem-solving techniques and heir application to selected case studies and a project that replicates actual on-the-job activities. Successful completion of this course, with a minimum final grade of 65%, will qualify as an approved credit towards the academic component of either the Certified Human Resources Professional (CHRP) or the Certified Human Resources Leader (CHRL) designations granted by the Human Resources Professionals Association (HRPA).
