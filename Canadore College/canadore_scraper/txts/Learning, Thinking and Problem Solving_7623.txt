Learning, Thinking and Problem Solving
Overview
Psychology is an academic discipline that is concerned with all aspects of human existence, focusing in particular upon human thought, emotion and action. Psychology combines the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes with the development of therapeutic and practical approaches to human problems and concerns. Psychology is, in addition, a major contributor to the ongoing development of our understanding of human nature more generally. After a brief historical overview, this subject examines psychology as a science. Psychological research and theory making facilitates our understanding of ourselves as individuals and as members of social groups by describing, explaining and predicting how we develop and relate in society, how we create ourselves and our world; applied psychology makes its contribution through efforts to enhance individual development and adaptation within society. Students benefit by gaining an introductory knowledge of psychology that can be applied to their daily lives.

Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes represent culminating demonstrations of learning and achievement. In addition, learning outcomes are interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolation of one another. As such, they should be viewed as a comprehensive whole. They describe performances that demonstrate that significant integrated learning by graduates of the program has been achieved.
