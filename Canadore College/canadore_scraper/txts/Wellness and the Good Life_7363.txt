Wellness and the Good Life
Overview
In this course, students will explore Indigenous perspectives of the good life (mino-pimatisiwin in Anishinaabemowin) and learn to develop a holistic view of how a relationship with the land, family, community, and culture contribute to an individual’s overall wellness. Students will discover concepts of colonization, oppression, healing, and resistance in order to develop their ability to think critically and understand different worldviews. This course emphasizes the importance of increasing a student’s understanding of what encompasses an individual’s whole health (spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical). Warning: Please be advised that this course may contain distressing material and/or elicit feelings of distress in an effort to unpack those feelings on your journey to mino-pimatisiwin. Please consider your personal well-being prior to enrolling in this course.
