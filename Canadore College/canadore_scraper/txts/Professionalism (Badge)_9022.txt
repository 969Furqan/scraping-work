Professionalism (Badge)
Overview
When providing client care, you want to present as a professional that is there to provide compassionate care while maintaining the focus of DIPPS. DIPPS is an acronym that is used to remind you that the focus of your care should be on maintaining a client’s
D
ignity, their
I
ndependence, their
P
rivacy, their
P
references, and their
S
afety. In all aspects of care, DIPPS should be at the forefront of your mind so that you remember to preserve these elements for your client at all times.
This 10 hour badge is focusing on professionalism because you have not chosen a job, you have chosen a profession. You will be representing your health care team to your client, and you will be representing your client to the health care team. In many cases, you will have more interactions with your client than any other member of your team. You want to make sure that you are presenting yourself in a respectable way and this badge will help you develop the skills you need to do so.
