Social Media and Society
Overview
In a few short years, social media has profoundly changed the global communication landscape. With the advent of social media tools such Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, and Twitter, more and more people are connecting and collaborating online, and creating and distributing content in ways we have never seen before. This course will provide a summary of the major developments in social media and will examine how social media is changing media, business, government, the economy, development, and education in fundamental ways. Students will be introduced to a variety of social media environments and will gain hands-on experience with many of the leading social media applications. This course requires active participation of students and a willingness to immerse in social media practices.
