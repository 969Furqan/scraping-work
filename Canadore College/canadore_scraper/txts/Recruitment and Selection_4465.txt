Recruitment and Selection
Overview
A basic study is undertaken of the principles, issues, trends, and legislative requirements affecting recruitment and selection. Human Resources professionals need an understanding of how recruitment and selection fits into the broader organizational structure, processes, and goals of an organization and how this function is related to the other functions of Human Resources management. Students will acquire the knowledge and skills needed to successfully identify human resource requirements and attract and retain an effective workforce for an organization. The changing legal environment and the impact of laws on recruitment and selection are an important component of this course.
