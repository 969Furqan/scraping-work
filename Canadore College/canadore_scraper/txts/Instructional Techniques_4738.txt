Instructional Techniques
Overview
In today’s complex learning environment, the most successful instructors/trainers demonstrate instructional strategies that both respect and challenge adult learners. Through lectures, discussion (synchronous and asynchronous) and various assignments, you will explore a wide variety of instructional techniques including: lecture, group discussion, demonstration, icebreakers, case study, brainstorming, debate, fishbowl, collage, role-play, panel discussions and skits. Factors affecting the selection of techniques will also be addressed. Participants will demonstrate their mastery of instructional techniques through the design and online delivery of a lesson. Some of the most common instructional strategies include co-operative learning, problem-based learning, active learning, classroom management issues and the use of media and resources.

Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes represent culminating demonstrations of learning and achievement. In addition, learning outcomes are interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolation of one another. As such, they should be viewed as a comprehensive whole. They describe performances that demonstrate that significant integrated learning by graduates of the program has been achieved.
