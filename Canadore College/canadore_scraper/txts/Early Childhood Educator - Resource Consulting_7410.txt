Early Childhood Educator - Resource Consulting
Overview
This online graduate certificate (7 course) program has been designed to meet the needs of individuals who have already received their Early Childhood Education Diploma (or equivalency granted by the Association of Early Childhood Educators of Ontario, AECEO), and who wish to pursue professional specialization. It provides early childhood educators with the knowledge and techniques necessary to promote the inclusion of children with identified barriers to learning. The RTI online part-time program emphasizes the ability of the adult learner to plan and carry out a professional course of study. The learning process is aimed at developing competent professional members of a transdisciplinary team. Faculty act as resource persons to facilitate the student’s progress through the program. Field work experiences take place in integrated settings, with families and community agencies and are a required component of the certificate program.
Note:
Students have up to 7 years to complete all requirements.
