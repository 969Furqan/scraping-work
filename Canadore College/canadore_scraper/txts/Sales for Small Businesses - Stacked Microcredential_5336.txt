Sales for Small Businesses - Stacked Microcredential
Overview
This stackable micro-credential is comprised of four competency-based micro-credentials. It is designed for small business entrepreneurs and/or their employees who have expertise with the product or service they are marketing, but little to no experience in business-to-consumer (B2C) sales. Participants will master skills relating to positioning products and services as customer needs-based solutions, building virtual relationships with customers and networking across the business community, prospecting, leveraging technologies for social selling, and negotiating, closing and following up on sales.
