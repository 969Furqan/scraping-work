Adapting & Modifying Curriculum Practices
Overview
Students are introduced to the Family Service Plan as the consultation platform that integrates perspectives from families, early learning educators, health professionals and community services providers in order to adapt and modify curriculum practices. Students examine early learning environments and create a plan that recommends strategies, adaptations and modifications that promote the benefits of inclusive learning for children with special needs. In addition, students develop a proposal of how they plan to communicate this information to the full Family Service Team. This course highlights the importance of working in consultation with the whole team in order to support children.

Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes represent culminating demonstrations of learning and achievement. In addition, learning outcomes are interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolation of one another. As such, they should be viewed as a comprehensive whole. They describe performances that demonstrate that significant integrated learning by graduates of the program has been achieved.
