Academic and Career Entrance (ACE) Study Option
Overview
Missing a prerequisite for college? ACE is the Academic and Career Entrance Program, delivered by all 24 Ontario community colleges. ACE is recognized as the Grade 12 equivalent for admission to college programs and apprenticeship training. A growing number of employers also recognize ACE for hiring purposes.
ACE is now available through online study. You can register for any of the ACE courses through Canadore College. The Learn to Learn (L2L) module is a prerequisite for all ACE online courses.
Note:
Each semester, there are a limited number of tuition-free seats available in ACE online courses for eligible students. Eligible students must be residents of Ontario who are taking the course for the first time. All other students must register with Durham College and pay applicable fees. Please visit
ACE Distance
for more detailed information about eligibility and registering in these courses.

Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes represent culminating demonstrations of learning and achievement. In addition, learning outcomes are interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolation of one another. As such, they should be viewed as a comprehensive whole. They describe performances that demonstrate that significant integrated learning by graduates of the program has been achieved.
