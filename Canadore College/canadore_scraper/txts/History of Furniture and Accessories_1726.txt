If English is not your first language you must provide proof of English competency. You must have a minimum overall band score of 5.5 on the Academic International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or equivalent accepted English language proficiency test to be admitted to a postsecondary program at the college. Notwithstanding the above, the English proficiency standards required to obtain Study Permits and Temporary Resident Visas from Canadian Embassies vary around the world. The higher English language proficiency standard will apply.  The Student Direct Stream (SDS) is an expedited study permit processing program for those who are applying to study in Canada at a post-secondary designated learning institution (DLI). The language requirement is more stringent than listed above, as such an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score of 6.0 or higher in each language skill: listening, reading, writing and speaking is required.  For more information on the Student Direct Stream (SDS) program please see:  https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/direct-stream.html#toc02, You may enroll in a Continuing Education course at Canadore College if you are 19 years of age or older or if you have earned an Ontario Secondary School Diploma/Ontario Secondary School Graduation Diploma or equivalent.
