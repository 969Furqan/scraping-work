Intro to Political Science (Degree Level)
Overview
The world of politics can be difficult to understand without some theoretical training. Yet it is vital for citizens of a democracy to understand how politics works. For all its complexity and frequent inelegance, politics is what allows humans to manage their differences, share their resources, protect their rights, and change their governments. In this course political science methodologies, approaches and theories will be introduced, allowing students to learn how the state, the structures of government and the political process impact their daily lives. Students will deepen their understanding of politics and political ideologies and learn how they are relevant to securing or advancing their material interests.
