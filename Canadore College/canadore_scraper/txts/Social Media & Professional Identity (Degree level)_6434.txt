Social Media & Professional Identity (Degree level)
Overview
Every day, millions of people share their opinions with a global audience via Tweets, #s, blogs, wikis, videos, likes, tags, text messages and online comments. Digital spaces and mobile technologies allow us to be connected to our personal and professional networks and communities 24/7. In what ways does this hyper-connectivity impact the ways in which people regard their place in the world and define themselves? In this course we will analyze the social, ethical, political and cultural ramifications of societies that are increasingly mobile and digital. The impact of new genres and forms of expression on our identities will be explored as we actively participate in online networks and create materials for social media.
