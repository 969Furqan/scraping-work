Methods of Fundraising
Overview
Issues and processes involved in designing, planning and organizing special events are presented. Students examine the organization, advantages and disadvantages of special events as a fundraising technique including tasks and responsibilities, working with committees, creative development of event concepts, scheduling and budgeting and strategies for maximizing profits from the event. Corporate partnerships and grant seeking, and entrepreneurial and third-party fundraising activities are also examined. Students develop fundraising plans according to the needs and capabilities of the organization they represent, such as finances and human resources. Relationships with the corporate sector and the means to identify their interest in fundraising are explored.
