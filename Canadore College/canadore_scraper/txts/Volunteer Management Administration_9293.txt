Volunteer Management Administration
Overview
This course focuses on the administrative tasks and processes involved in volunteer management. This course will help you understand the support system behind volunteer engagement, whether it be the use and application of software programs; the development of policies & procedures; creating a budget; resolving conflict or creating your own filing system/templates of forms. We will explore these, along with the role that associations (local, provincial and national) play in supporting your continued path of professional development.
