Part Time
On Death, Dying and Medical Assistance in Dying
Overview
Though death is an immutable consequence of life, society’s attitudes and reactions to it have been ever-changing. The viewpoint that life is sacrosanct, to be protected at all costs, is now being challenged by individuals demanding greater control of their quality of life, including the right to die. An historical overview of attitudes towards death will be examined, with a focus on the growing acceptability of medical assistance in dying (MAID), and the reasons behind this movement (demographics, economics, medicine). This course, through discussion of differing social perspectives, government legislation, case studies, research, images and videos will provide students a greater understanding of society’s past and present approaches to death.
