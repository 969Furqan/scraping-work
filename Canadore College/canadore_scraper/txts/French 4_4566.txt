French 4
Overview
In addition to a more rigorous approach to vocabulary and grammatical structures with every class the student will continue to develop everyday situations practiced at earlier levels. Grammatical sentence structures are more complex at this level with the expansion of the past, present, future and conditional verb tenses. Articles from French speaking Canada serve as language models and provide a cultural perspective on current issues. Towards the end of the course language skills include the ability to convey necessity, obligation, probability, and or expectation with regards to past experiences, work and education and the future.
