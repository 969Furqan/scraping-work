Evaluating Impact of Learning on Performance (Micro-credential)
Overview
In the Evaluating the Impact of Learning on Performance micro-credential, students identify and track a series of metrics such as participation, satisfaction, knowledge transfer, behavior change, and business impact for learning programs. Students examine the importance of assessment, scheduling and frequency, and how to communicate the need and effectiveness of learning with appropriate stakeholders. Emphasis is on measuring a learning opportunity with an accompanying plan and reporting on the business impact of learning within the organization. Measuring the impact of learning on business performance is also addressed.

Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes represent culminating demonstrations of learning and achievement. In addition, learning outcomes are interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolation of one another. As such, they should be viewed as a comprehensive whole. They describe performances that demonstrate that significant integrated learning by graduates of the program has been achieved.
