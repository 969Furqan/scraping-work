History of Indigenous Canadian Relations
Overview
This course provides an overview of the historic stages of the relationship between Indigenous peoples in Canada from contact to present day. It will explore the different world views at contact, the years of cooperation and negotiation through the fur trade and treaty making era and the impact of government colonial policy on Indigenous nations. The course will also explore the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal rights which provide an important context for understanding contemporary issues between Indigenous and Canadian societies including land claims, treaties and self-government.
