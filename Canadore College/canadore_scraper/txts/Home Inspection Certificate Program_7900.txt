Home Inspection Certificate Program
Overview
In partnership with Seneca College and Carson Dunlop and Associates, and in co-operation with the Ontario Association of Home Inspectors (OAHI), Durham offers a 10-course Home Inspection program that incorporates the Standards of Practice of the American Society of Home Inspectors/Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors (ASHI/CAHPI). Standards of Practice define a minimum and uniform standard for private, fee-paid home inspectors. The Carson Dunlop and Associates program has been adopted by the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI), and is also recognized and recommended by the Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors (CAHPI) in all Provinces. The Carson Dunlop program complies with ASHI Curriculum and Standards of Practice. The program also meets the Professional Home/Property Inspector Occupational Standards developed by the Canadian Home Inspectors and Building Officials Steering Committee for National Standards (CHIBO). The systems and components of a house include roofing, structure, electrical systems, heating systems, air conditioning/heat pumps, plumbing, the exterior, insulation and the interior. These courses have been created to address each of these components, as well as help you acquire the knowledge and professional communication skills you need to succeed in this growing industry. Throughout the program you will focus on obtaining a very practical knowledge of the performance of the systems and components of a house. Curriculum has been thoughtfully organized into subjects that describe the materials used in the construction of each house system and how they are assembled. Content covers what may go wrong as well as the causes and the implications of problems that result. The program gives students clear direction concerning what to look for during an inspection: signs of non-performance due to old age, deferred maintenance, weather damage, and poor workmanship. It is this aspect of the program that distinguishes it from the knowledge of contractors or other building professionals. Successful completion of this program fulfils the academic entrance requirements of the Ontario Association of Home Inspectors (OAHI) provided that a 70% average is maintained in each of the courses being submitted to OAHI for consideration, except for the Defect Recognition and Reporting course (available only from OAHI) and the Ontario Building Code courses: Part Nine – Building Envelope; Part Nine – Health and Safety, (available through OAHI). For full details, please contact the OAHI at 1.888.744.6244 or visit the OAHI Web site at www.oahi.com
