Project Management for Course Development
Overview
Instructional design involves managing not only the design of curriculum in order to meet learning outcomes but also managing time requirements and other tangible and intangible resources. This course explores the important concepts in project management specifically for educational design and development. We look at time management and cost control, conducting a proper needs analysis from an institutional level as well as strategies for determining scope.
