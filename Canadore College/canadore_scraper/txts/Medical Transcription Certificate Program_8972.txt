Employment opportunities may include medical transcriber’s positions in hospital departments of Health Records, Diagnostic Imaging, and Pathology, in various medical clinics, or in private practice specialties and other community facilities, physicians’ offices, and online transcription companies. This certificate is available entirely through distance education.
