Field Placement II (ECE Resource Consulting)
Overview
This field placement experience extends the students’ understanding of the role of the ECE Resource Consultant. Working as a member of the service team, students act in accordance with legislative regulations, agency policies and professional standards. They will demonstrate family-centred strategies as they guide families to navigate potential supports and services and make recommendations that support the healthy development of children living with special needs. Through the use of reciprocal communication and evidence-informed practices, they will apply the principles of adult learning in order to co-ordinate and facilitate case management meetings, educational opportunities and referral discussions. They will reflect upon their consultation practices, evaluate strengths and challenges, and create a plan for further professional development.
