Multimedia for Online Learning
Overview
There is abundant research demonstrating that not all students learn the same way and therefore it is important to cater to a variety of modalities when designing online educational materials. By identifying the purpose of multimedia design, students will create a short learning unit that demonstrates their understanding of best practices and skills in audio, video, and graphic design. Students will also learn copyright law as it pertains to educational use of materials.
