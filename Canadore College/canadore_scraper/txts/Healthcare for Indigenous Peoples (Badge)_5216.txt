Healthcare for Indigenous Peoples (Badge)
Overview
The Healthcare for Indigenous Peoples Badge provides the learner with the opportunity to understand more about Canada’s First Peoples, their history, and experiences from colonialism to the present day.  Participants are introduced to a number of foundational Indigenous principles and practices such as the story of creation, natural law, traditional healing philosophy and practices, the four sacred medicines and the importance of ceremony and community.
This 10 hour course also aims to enhance awareness regarding how the individual and collective historical experience of the Indigenous Peoples of Canada might impact the current delivery of healthcare within Indigenous communities, and what you as a healthcare provider can do to improve that experience and relationship.
