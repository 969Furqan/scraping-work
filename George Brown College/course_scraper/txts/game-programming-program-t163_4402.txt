Program Overview
The three-year
Game – Programming
advanced diploma program will give you the technical skills you need to succeed in the growing gaming industry. You’ll learn the “language” of gaming (C and C++), artificial intelligence, 3D graphics and more.
PLEASE NOTE

Game – Programming (Online) program (T193)
for more details.
Full Description
Whether online or console, cellphone or PC-based, the game industry in Canada is booming. Game developers and publishers in the Greater Toronto Area range from small, specialized units to mid-sized companies, including Microsoft, Nintendo and other industry leaders.
Computers and game programmers are not just essential; they are in high demand in the thriving game industry in Canada. Our industry advisors confirm that technical skills are a hot commodity. As a graduate of our three-year Game – Programming (Online) advanced diploma program, you’ll be equipped to meet this demand and provide employers in this sector with the skills they’re actively seeking.
The added advantage of this program is that our School of Design faculty will guide you throughout the program as you work closely with design students to create games, explore all aspects of the game industry, and learn to work in teams – just as you would in the industry.
Classes occur at our Waterfront Campus, and evening courses may be required.
Note:
Students who start the program in January (winter term) must attend classes during the summer months (May to August).

Industry
“Canada's video game industry is recognized as a global powerhouse for game development and has played a significant role in shifting what was once a ‘niche industry’ into a blockbuster industry and driver of innovation. In 2015, the industry contributed more than $3 billion to the Canadian economy and provided 20,400 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs across the country, representing an increase of 31 percent and 24 percent respectively since 2013.
“Industry growth both globally and in Canada has been explosive and is expected to continue into the future.​ Canada’s video game industry crosses the country with 472 active studios that develop, publish and distribute video games. The sector is mainly concentrated in the provinces of Quebec (29.4 per cent), British Columbia (27.1 per cent) and Ontario (22.9 per cent).” – Entertainment Software Association of Canada

It is said that what you put into life is what you get out of it. This is also true of Game – Programming (T163). While some of our graduates have gone on to notable studios like Ubisoft and Rockstar, others form a strong bond and stick together even after graduation. One such case is a group of exceptional T163 students who formed their own entity, called No Sleep, even before graduation.
The members of No Sleep created the group in their first semester Game Production class. In third year, they produced a game that won several awards, including the Best Student Showcase at Digifest 2018.
No Sleep member and Chair's Award winner Mark Miller had this advice for current students: "So long as everyone is putting in their share of the work, and is [attending class], no one is left behind."
Jack Wiebe, a Game – Programming student, was part of a research team working with Vitruvian Sport Systems to revolutionize soccer training. They developed Zone360 – a digital training platform that brings the soccer pitch to players’ smartphones, using virtual reality to deliver immersive drills and plays. Jack says working on the project has given him a broad range of experience, from building 3D environments to collaborating with artists. Best of all, his portfolio now includes a professional project that incorporates mobile technology, virtual reality and the artificial intelligence of IBM’s supercomputer, Watson. “That’s going to be hugely beneficial when I’m looking for jobs,” says Wiebe.
