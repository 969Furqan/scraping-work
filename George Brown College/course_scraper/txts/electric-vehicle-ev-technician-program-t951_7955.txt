Program Description
Program Overview
The
Electric Vehicle (EV) Technician
training program addresses a global need for people who are skilled in diagnosing, servicing and repairing high voltage EVs, and commercial charging stations.
You’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of electrical vehicle circuits through a blend of theoretical and hands-on instruction. Our multimedia learning resources and cutting-edge electrical/electronics simulation software (CircuitLogix Pro) enable you to test, validate and understand the complexities of circuits commonly found in EVs.
This program is highly beneficial to Automotive Service Technicians who have a strong background in internal combustion engine (ICE) powered vehicles, but lack the skills in power electronics and data communication systems to safely perform service-related work on EVs and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). This program is also relevant to electricians who will be installing, servicing and maintaining residential and commercial EV charging stations.
International Students:
This online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and
does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.
Full Description
The 32-week
Electric Vehicle (EV) Technician
certificate program is structured into 14 modules, each containing around 10 major topics. Delivered in an asynchronous “on demand” format, this setup allows you to start and finish modules at your own pace.
A key feature of the program is the integration of theory and hands-on learning. Comprising 14 modules, our curriculum includes state-of-the-art simulation software with virtual lab/shop experiments, combined with videos, animations and real-world practical examples to reinforce the fundamental concepts of EV technology. As a student in the program, you’ll receive a licensed copy of CircuitLogix, which incorporates both 2D- and 3D-simulation.
While the typical program duration is around 32 weeks, there are no fixed schedules for completion. This flexibility allows you to progress through the course content at your own pace. Each module concludes with an online final exam.
