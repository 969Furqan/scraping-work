Program Learning Outcomes
Every credential at George Brown College delivers detailed program learning outcomes that are discipline-specific and aligned with the appropriate credential level. Program learning outcomes are statements that describe the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate by the end of their program of study.
In addition to the learning outcome requirements, college programs are required to provide students with exposure to a breadth of learning beyond their core disciplinary or vocational field, to increase their awareness of the society and culture in which they live and work. This breadth requirement is addressed for college programs through additional mandatory General Education or Liberal Studies courses in the program curriculum. Also, programs are designed to provide essential transferable skills (referred to sometimes as essential employability skills), which include: communication, numeracy, critical thinking and problem-solving, information management, interpersonal and personal skills, among others.
