"I had an amazing experience at George Brown College. I chose a wonderful career where I had the immense fortune to meet great classmates and teachers, who not only taught us the key concepts in the class but also encouraged us to be successful in the field. George Brown College also helped me to fulfill my academic experience by being the bridge that allowed me to be part of the Pan Am/Parapan Am Games during my co-op terms, which had a great impact on my career and future."

"I had an amazing experience at George Brown College. I chose a wonderful career where I had the immense fortune to meet great classmates and teachers, who not only taught us the key concepts in the class but also encouraged us to be successful in the field. George Brown College also helped me to fulfill my academic experience by being the bridge that allowed me to be part of the Pan Am/Parapan Am Games during my co-op terms, which had a great impact on my career and future."
