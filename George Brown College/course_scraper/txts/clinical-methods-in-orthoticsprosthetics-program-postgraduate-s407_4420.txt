Your Field Education Options
The on-site and off-site clinical experience in this Clinical Methods in Orthotics/Prosthetics program plays an essential role in preparing you for the real work ahead.
During the Clinical Techniques classes each semester, you will have the chance to work directly with clients who require prosthetic/orthotic treatment. Provision and evaluation of treatment will be unique to suit each client’s individual needs.
Treatment will include:
an assessment
measurements
shape-capture by hand
scanning and rectification of plaster and digital positive models
Design and fabrication of the prosthetic/orthotic devices take place in the laboratory procedures courses.
On-site Grand Rounds sessions are held monthly and will require you to give a monthly presentation on a related topic to a group of faculty, students and sector partners.
For details about Grand Rounds, please visit this link to their website
.
Since 1979, the Prosthetic & Orthotic programs have required students to present various topics in a more formalized setting to try to enhance their presentation skills and to encourage them to continue this activity into their professional lives. These sessions normally take place on the evening of the first Tuesday of every month. Both venues are located in the Sunnybrook Health Science Centre. We welcome anyone interested to please attend the sessions.
The strength of the program is the structured clinical education provided by various clinical settings. In conjunction with the curriculum changes made over the years, there are many clinical facilities and practitioners participating to deliver the various segments of the program.
PLEASE NOTE:
As a student in this program, you will be required to travel to the various hospitals and clinics in the program by either personal or public transportation.
