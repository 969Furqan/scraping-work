"Starting in a new country was always going to be a complex experience to navigate, but I’m happy that I chose George Brown College as the starting point to my journey here. Beyond the academics, I truly found a good group of fellow students to learn with and grow alongside.
Even in the midst of COVID, George Brown professors and staff made the effort to keep things involved and relevant for us. In fact, I particularly enjoyed the summer co-op program as it allowed me to get exposed to the wider job market that’s still related to my field. All in all, if you put in the work, you’ll find new ways to learn that can take you even further."
