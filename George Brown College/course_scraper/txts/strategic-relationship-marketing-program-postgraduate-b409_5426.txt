Your Field Education Options
Work Experience (co-op or internship work term)
This program requires the successful completion of a one-semester work experience to graduate. This work experience is either co-op (paid) or internship (unpaid). Either one will give you the practical experience employers value.
The work term occurs after the end of the second academic semester.
George Brown works with employers and industry partners to identify potential work experience opportunities. Students then apply for these opportunities and go through a competitive interview process. Students are also strongly encouraged to pursue self-directed industry work experience opportunities they believe will provide the learning experiences they value and meet the learning outcomes of the program. This valuable work experience can, in turn, be added to their resumé.
In addition to on-the-job work experience, George Brown College endeavours to provide field education opportunities with real-world challenges and clients. Find out more about

I came to Canada leaving behind the corporate world to pursue my dreams and it was indeed a big milestone to achieve. Strategic Relationship Marketing is the most intense and practical program for marketers interested in data analytics, market research and consumer insights. The on-campus and off-campus opportunities are amazing at George Brown and they gave me a chance to develop industry relationships. I ended up doing a co-op in the Marketing department of the college and the experience has been incredible. It has definitely opened many doors to pursue a full-time job later in the field of marketing. My potential has been best recognized here and I am proud to choose George Brown College as a stepping stone to my success.

I came to Canada leaving behind the corporate world to pursue my dreams and it was indeed a big milestone to achieve. Strategic Relationship Marketing is the most intense and practical program for marketers interested in data analytics, market research and consumer insights. The on-campus and off-campus opportunities are amazing at George Brown and they gave me a chance to develop industry relationships. I ended up doing a co-op in the Marketing department of the college and the experience has been incredible. It has definitely opened many doors to pursue a full-time job later in the field of marketing. My potential has been best recognized here and I am proud to choose George Brown College as a stepping stone to my success.
