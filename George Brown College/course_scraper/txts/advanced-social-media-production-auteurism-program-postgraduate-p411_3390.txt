Social media has profoundly transformed our interpersonal connections, bridging gaps among friends, family and strangers worldwide. Its dynamic and evolving modes of interaction have prompted numerous companies to continually refine their marketing and advertising strategies for reaching potential consumers. As the omnipresence of social media continues to shape our daily lives, it becomes imperative to introspect on how it has altered our existence and, reciprocally, how our changing lifestyles have influenced its trajectory.
