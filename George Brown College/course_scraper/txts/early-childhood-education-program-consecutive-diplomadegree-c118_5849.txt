Program Description
Leadership Claims
Preparing graduates to work as early childhood educators for more than 40 years.
Program Overview
The
Early Childhood Education (Consecutive Diploma/Degree) (C118)
program is a joint offering with Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). In just four years, you will earn both a Diploma from George Brown and Degree from TMU. Launch your career in early childhood education with both a diploma and a degree in just four years.
Full Description
This Early Childhood Education program is currently offering a $2,000 tuition grant to domestic students starting in September 2024.*
As a graduate of the four-year Early Childhood Education (Consecutive Diploma/Degree) (C118) program, you'll enter the workforce with two credentials—an Early Childhood Education (ECE) diploma from George Brown College (GBC) and a Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Studies from Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). This program offers distinct advantages including college-level tuition fees for the first two years, rather than higher university fees, and the expanded career scope and direction the two credentials can provide.
*This opportunity is funded in partnership with the
City of Toronto
,
the Region of Durham
,
the Region of Peel
, the Province of Ontario, and the Government of Canada under the new Canada-Ontario Early Childhood Workforce Agreement, which provides one-time federal funding to support the retention and recruitment of a high-quality child care and early years workforce.
To solidify your learning as you go, this program alternates between in-class learning and field placement experiences. This integrated approach not only helps you develop confidence in your skills as you progress throughout the program but will ensure you are ready to work immediately upon graduation.
During years one and two (GBC diploma), you will learn:
the holistic development of infants, toddlers, preschoolers and school-aged children
how to support children as they grow
how to plan and implement programs that support children's learning
You will also engage with families and the broader community.
In years three and four (TMU degree), you will:
study policy, advocacy and legislation as they relate to the early childhood sector
explore the cognitive development of young children as it relates to literacy, creativity, science, technology, and more
engage in a research project
Your Field Education Options
Field placement plays a significant role in this Early Childhood Education Consecutive Diploma/Degree program by providing you with the opportunity to integrate and apply classroom theory to practice.
Placements are offered in semesters 1, 2, 3 and 4, three days per week, seven weeks per semester. During this time, you will have the chance to work with children of different age groups in a variety of settings.
To support your learning outcomes and ensure you have access to facilities that model the best practices we consider essential, we operate Ontario's largest network of college-run lab school child care centres that serve over 1,000 children and their families each year. These
13 child care centres
located across Toronto, will not only expose you to the kinds of environments where you will eventually work, but they also provide valuable services to the families and communities they serve.
Please note:
Many field placement partners may require you to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 (a person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose). As such, if you are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you may be unable to complete your program's required field placement component in the regularly scheduled time frame.

Narmin Pirani was finishing her bachelor’s degree in sociology when she took a job in a hospital child care centre to help pay her bills. That’s where she found her true calling.
"I discovered that I loved working with little kids. It came naturally to me, and I knew it was the kind of job that I’d look forward to every day," she remembers.
Narmin knew she'd need training if she wanted to get serious. When she looked at the options, George Brown College's Early Childhood Education program interested her right away, particularly the seven weeks of in-class followed by the seven weeks of field placement.
"The courses at George Brown sounded more academic compared to the other ECE programs I was considering, but the main thing that appealed [to me] was the amount of field placement," says Narmin. "We learned how to handle every possible situation in the classroom, but then when you have to use that information for real, you discover all the things that can't be taught in a book. There’s no better way to learn."

Special Requirements
Field placement is a mandatory and complex component of the program. Should accommodation issues arise, an Accessible Learning consultant may be called upon to assist the applicant in determining whether she/he can meet the requirements necessary for safe caregiving for young children.
In compliance with requests from our student placement partners and requirements from Public Health and Ontario legislation, all students in this program must have completed the following prior to beginning field placement:
standard first aid with CPR level C course
police vulnerable sector check
medical clearance
Students who are unable to provide completed field clearance documents may be unable to complete their field placement and, therefore, be unable to complete the program.
For more information on the ECE field placement requirements, please email
ece@georgebrown.ca.

Narmin Pirani was finishing her bachelor’s degree in sociology when she took a job in a hospital child care centre to help pay her bills. That’s where she found her true calling.
"I discovered that I loved working with little kids. It came naturally to me, and I knew it was the kind of job that I’d look forward to every day," she remembers.
Narmin knew she'd need training if she wanted to get serious. When she looked at the options, George Brown College's Early Childhood Education program interested her right away, particularly the seven weeks of in-class followed by the seven weeks of field placement.
"The courses at George Brown sounded more academic compared to the other ECE programs I was considering, but the main thing that appealed [to me] was the amount of field placement," says Narmin. "We learned how to handle every possible situation in the classroom, but then when you have to use that information for real, you discover all the things that can't be taught in a book. There’s no better way to learn."
