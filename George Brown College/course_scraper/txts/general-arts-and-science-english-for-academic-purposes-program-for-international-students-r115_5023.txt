Important information about EAP as a conditional pathway to a post-secondary program
Important
: If you are applying for the George Brown College English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program as a conditional pathway to a post-secondary program, please note the following:
You must meet eligibility requirements for the diploma/degree/postgraduate program you are applying for and submit supporting documents required. Please see the
list of supporting documents required.
We will review your application and if you are eligible, we will issue you a conditional letter of acceptance for both the EAP and the post-secondary program. This letter will assist you in applying for a Study Permit.
If you did not submit an IELTS or TOEFL or Duolingo score, you will be required to take the EAP level placement test after you arrive at George Brown College.
The results of the placement test will reflect your language ability and determine your starting level in the EAP program.
Once you know your EAP level, you will be required to contact your admissions officer at the International Centre to re-initiate your post-secondary program application because the date of your post-secondary program may have changed due to your EAP placement test result.
When you are finally accepted to the post-secondary program at this second stage, depending on availability, your post-secondary seat will be secure.
In all cases, final admission will be subject to diploma/degree/postgraduate program availability at the time of completion of EAP requirements.
Placement Test
Once students have registered, they will take a placement test to determine their level of English proficiency before beginning the EAP program. A test time will be provided upon registration.
Applicants have two options for determining level placement. Students must choose one option only and once the choice is made, it is final.
EAP applicants who do not have an IELTS (Academic), TOEFL (iBT) or Duolingo score will need to take the online EAP level placement test.
Alternatively, applicants can also be placed into an EAP level before session start based on a TOEFL (iBT), IELTS (Academic), or Duolingo score with the minimum Writing and Speaking score requirements shown below.

March 4–April 26, 2024
session and beyond, the School of ESL will no longer accept the Duolingo (DET) score from *
current EAP (R105/R115) program
students who seek to skip a language level or be considered for placement into a different EAP level. Current students will still be able to submit IELTS Academic or TOEFL iBT scores for consideration into a different EAP level; however, these scores
will not be accepted for advancing to the next EAP program level if a student has received a failing grade in their current level.

Important information about EAP as a conditional pathway to a post-secondary program
IMPORTANT: If you are applying for the George Brown College English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program as a conditional pathway to a post-secondary program, please note the following:
You must meet eligibility requirements for the diploma/degree/postgraduate program you are applying for and submit supporting documents required. Please see the
list of supporting documents required.
We will review your application and if you are eligible, we will issue you a conditional letter of acceptance for both the EAP and the post-secondary program. This letter will assist you in applying for a Study Permit.
If you did not submit an IELTS or TOEFL or Duolingo score, you will be required to take the EAP level placement test after you arrive at George Brown College.
The results of the placement test will reflect your language ability and determine your starting level in the EAP program.
Once you know your EAP level, you will be required to contact your admissions officer at the International Centre to re-initiate your post-secondary program application because the date of your post-secondary program may have changed due to your EAP placement test result.
When you are finally accepted to the post-secondary program at this second stage, depending on availability, your post-secondary seat will be secure.
In all cases, final admission will be subject to diploma/degree/postgraduate program availability at the time of completion of EAP requirements.
Placement Test
Once students have registered, they will take a placement test to determine their level of English proficiency before beginning the EAP program. A test time will be provided upon registration.
Applicants have two options for determining level placement. Students must choose one option only and once the choice is made, it is final.
EAP applicants who do not have an IELTS (Academic), TOEFL (iBT) or Duolingo score will need to take the online EAP level placement test.
Alternatively, applicants can also be placed into an EAP level before session start based on a TOEFL (iBT), IELTS (Academic), or Duolingo score with the minimum Writing and Speaking score requirements shown below.

You will be placed in the EAP starting level that corresponds to your lowest score in all test sections. For students interested in taking the IELTS test in Toronto, the George Brown college official IELTS test centre provides a complete IELTS testing service. For more information, please visit the
IELTS Testing service
site.
George Brown College Admissions Officers reserve the right to require TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo results for EAP level placement on all EAP applications.
Current or returning EAP students who suspend their studies for
more than six
consecutive 8-week sessions must retake the EAP level placement test or submit a valid IELTS/TOEFL/Duolingo score in order to be placed back into the program.
As of the
March 4 – April 26, 2024
session and beyond, the School of ESL will no longer accept the Duolingo (DET) score from *
current EAP (R105/R115) program
students who seek to skip a language level or be considered for placement into a different EAP level. Current students will still be able to submit IELTS Academic or TOEFL iBT scores for consideration into a different EAP level; however, these scores
will not be accepted for advancing to the next EAP program level if a student has received a failing grade in their current level.
*Current students are those enrolled in the presently ongoing EAP session or those who have studied in the EAP program within the past 2 years as of the start date of the next available EAP session.

​​​​​Note:
The Educational Testing Service (ETS) has rolled out a new global service to allow students to take the
TOEFL iBT
exams at home.  We will accept this at-home test at the same score levels as the regular test. The new at-home service is nearly global in that it is available to students worldwide with the exception of those in Mainland China and Iran.
