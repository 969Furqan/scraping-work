Program Description
Program Overview
This program is eligible for
an entrance scholarship.
The intersection of technology and personalized experiences is the cornerstone of the
Honours Bachelor of Commerce (Digital Marketing)
program. This four-year degree assembles two closely related industry realities: access to data, which offers opportunities for marketers to reach new audiences, and innovation in software and platforms, which has fostered personalized, direct communication with customers. Students will develop many essential skills and competencies in business concepts during the first two years of study, followed by analyzing and applying digital marketing concepts and practices in the final two years.
Full Description
The
Honours Bachelor of Commerce (Digital Marketing)
degree will enable graduates to succeed in a field that has transformed how products and services are marketed. Our graduates are empowered to conquer modern marketing challenges while harnessing the power of the internet.
This program begins with two foundational years common to other business degree programs, followed by two years focusing on specialized areas of digital marketing: owned media and social media. Additionally, students get to complete a suite of capstone courses and a work placement semester in the final two years.
Businesses need marketing professionals with a well-rounded education in all business areas to foster personalized experiences and manage the massive data sets now available. This program will demonstrate the use of digital devices, media, data, platforms, and technology to develop, implement and manage marketing campaigns that promote a company and its products and services.
Your Field Education Options
Within the School of Marketing, there are many opportunities to network and learn from industry practitioners through guest lectures, business and marketing networking events, competitions, and on-campus clubs.
