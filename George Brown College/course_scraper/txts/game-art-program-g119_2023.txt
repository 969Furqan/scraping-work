“At George Brown my professors were all people who worked, or are still working, in the industry allowing me to learn about it in its current form. Even now, working in the industry myself, some of the professors I had are now my coworkers. They taught me all the aspects of the development pipeline on top of my specialization helping me work comfortably between departments in the studio. Most importantly, I not only learned the software I need but learned how to learn, enabling me to quickly adapt to all sorts of complex and proprietary software and engines.”

“At George Brown my professors were all people who worked, or are still working, in the industry allowing me to learn about it in its current form. Even now, working in the industry myself, some of the professors I had are now my coworkers. They taught me all the aspects of the development pipeline on top of my specialization helping me work comfortably between departments in the studio. Most importantly, I not only learned the software I need but learned how to learn, enabling me to quickly adapt to all sorts of complex and proprietary software and engines.”
