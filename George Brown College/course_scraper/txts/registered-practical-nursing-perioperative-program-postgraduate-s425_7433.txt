Program Description
Program Overview
The
Registered Practical Nurse – Operating Room Perioperative Nursing
Program
prepares RPNs with the foundational theoretical and technical skills needed to work within their scope of practice in a perioperative setting. This program includes a theory and clinical practicum component.
Full Description
The
Registered Practical Nurse – Operating Room Perioperative Nursing
(Postgraduate S425)
program is designed to teach RPNs the skills required to work as part of a perioperative team in a perioperative setting at a beginner level. The program utilizes current perioperative nursing research and strictly adheres to the Operating Room Nurses Association of Canada (ORNAC) Standards of Practice.
As a student in this program, you will learn operating room principles and practice considerations for all surgical specialties. This includes the study of relevant anatomy, surgical modalities, surgical instrumentation and the nursing process of caring for perioperative patients.
You will be required to complete a clinical practicum in an operating room with an emphasis on the scrub nurse role in various surgical specialties.
Course Delivery
This course is delivered through multi-modal learning and includes:
synchronous and asynchronous in-class and online theory
lab skills and simulations
a clinical practicum experience
The program is organized in two phases.
Phase I: Nursing Theory and Lab Skills
During the first five weeks of this program, you will learn:
current ORNAC standards, principles and applications
practice considerations for all surgical specialties
surgical anatomy, modalities and instrumentation
role of the scrub nurse
clinical lab skills delivered in George Brown College's Operating Room Simulation Centre
Phase II: Clinical Practicum
You will then consolidate both operating room theory and principles and will complete an eight-week (320-hour) clinical placement at a designated hospital facility.
This clinical practicum includes:
development of the scrub nurse role
exposure to various surgical specialties (i.e., general surgery, urology, gynecology, plastic surgery, ENT and orthopedic surgery)
safe and professional practice
introduction to the circulating role (hospital site dependent)
While in the clinical setting, you will participate in online discussions through live video conferences and complete clinical assignments as per the course syllabus.
Clinical experiences are co-ordinated by the program co-ordinator at hospitals in and outside of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), or at the hospital where you currently work. If you are a sponsored (hired) student, you will complete your clinical placements at the hospital where you are employed.
PLEASE NOTE:
Public Health continues to recommend that people working with vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Clinical agency partners continue to require students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to be approved to complete clinical placements within their facilities. Agencies have the right to decline the placement of students who are not fully vaccinated, and students who are not vaccinated are at risk of not being able to complete their clinical placement course requirements.
