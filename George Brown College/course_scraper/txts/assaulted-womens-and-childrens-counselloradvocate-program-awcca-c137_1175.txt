Program Description
Leadership Claims
George Brown College has been preparing graduates to work as Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocates for over 30 years.
This program is unique in Canada.
Program Overview
The
Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocate (AWCCA)
program will prepare you to provide anti-oppressive counselling and advocacy for survivors of gender-based violence.
Full Description
The two-year
Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocate (AWCCA) (C137)
diploma program will provide you with a feminist, anti-racist analysis of the political and counselling issues related to gender-based violence experienced primarily by self-identified women, children, trans and non-binary survivors. It will train you to be an agent for change in the work of community education, political action and law reform and will prepare you to provide anti-oppressive counselling for survivors who have experienced or are experiencing gender-based violence.
Over four semesters, you will study the range of issues that impact and contribute to gender-based violence, such as social justice movements, privilege and oppression, violence in the digital world and more. You will also have the chance to practise your newly learned counselling skills off-site with one of our field placement partners. See 'Your Field Education Options' for details.
Vulnerable Sector Check
Please note that some of our student placement partners require you to have a Vulnerable Sector Check completed before your field placement.
These Vulnerable Sector Checks, which can take up to four months, are done to protect the clientele of these agencies, who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law.
The fees for the Vulnerable Sector Checks vary and must be paid for by you.
You are responsible for ensuring that the check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).” If you are unable to provide a clear Vulnerable Sector Check, you may find that your choice of placements is limited.
Accelerated AWCCA program
If you have an existing diploma or degree and/or equivalent work experience, we offer a three-semester condensed version of this two-year program. Visit the
AWCCA (Accelerated) (C147)
program page for more details.
Your Field Education Options
Field education plays an important role in George Brown's AWCCA program by preparing you to work with those affected by gender-based violence. It includes those directly impacted, and the communities within which they live and work and often encompasses those who identify as trans and non-binary, and other disenfranchised populations.
As a first year AWCCA student,you will take a class called Preparation for the Field, which includes introductory activities to the field, such as:
interviewing staff during an agency visit
conducting research to identify placement options that will meet your learning goals
participating in professional development activities
learning how programs and services are developed
As a second year AWCCA student, you will build on your learning by engaging in 400 hours of unpaid field placement. During these field experience hours you will participate in many of the following:
supportive counselling
group facilitation
case management and advocacy
intake and referrals
special projects and events
political advocacy
professional development
outreach and public education
project design and delivery
crisis intervention
Placements begin in September and continue through to the end of April for approximately 400 hours. Typical placement settings include emergency shelters, sexual assault and rape crisis centres, youth services, settlement agencies, health providers and other agencies that provide front-line support to survivors of gender-based violence.
Field placement agencies are very similar to those employing our graduates. In many instances, employers hire graduates because of contact and experience with them through fieldwork placement. Most agencies are within the Greater Toronto Area with other locations in Ontario and across Canada providing students with placement opportunities.

Upon graduating from the AWCCA program, you may find work in a variety of settings, including:
