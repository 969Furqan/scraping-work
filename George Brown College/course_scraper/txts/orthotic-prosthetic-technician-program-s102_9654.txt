Special Requirements
Clinical Pre-placement Health Form requirements and program policy (for 2
nd
year Returning students only)
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet and complete all the mandatory Pre-placement requirements for this program. It will take up to 8 to 10 weeks to complete.
Students will need to process and provide proof of their
medical records
(such as TDAP shot, COVID-19, MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titres and Two-Step TB Skin Test), proof of clear
Vulnerable Sector Check
renewed every year
,
CPR level C certificate
renewed every year, annual flu shot and
mask fit test
renewed every two years. These requirements must be submitted by the program specific deadline to
ParaMed Placement Pass website
.
COVID-19 vaccination:
Public Health recommends that people working with young children and other vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. As such, students who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may not be able to complete the required field placement component of their program in the regularly scheduled time frame.
The health policies and non-academic requirements are designed to protect clients and vulnerable populations whom students will engage in practice. Students who do not comply with the program’s health policy and non-academic requirements, or who do not submit all required documentation by deadlines established by the program will be excluded from the clinical practicum. Exclusion from clinical practicum for any reason may jeopardize students' academic standing and successful completion of this program.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student.
To download the mandatory Pre-placement health form and for more details, go to the
Clinical Pre-placement website.
Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy (renew every year)
In compliance with requests from our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a Vulnerable Sector Check completed, and this check must be renewed every year before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered "vulnerable persons" under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the police record check covers appropriateness for "individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s)."
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a "clear" vulnerable sector check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a "not clear" status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment. The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
Pre-placement website
.
Program Selection Process
The selection of students involves a two-step procedure:
i) Eligible applicants will be invited to take an online admissions test involving subjects covering English, physics, anatomy, and workshop awareness.

"The program is very, very hands-on. In addition to the academic side dealing with anatomy, pathology and biomechanics, we have two lab days per week where there's a full working shop. The program coordinators and all of the instructors are really passionate and very dedicated people. They really want to see you succeed.
I love the interaction that I get within the healthcare facility. But coupled with that, I get to work in a working shop. I get to build and put things together all day. We have a plaster room, a laminating room, a sewing room, a machine room with special sanders and grinders. I get to use all my own tools. God, it's great."

Special Requirements
Clinical Pre-placement Health Form requirements and program policy (for 2
nd
year Returning students only)
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet and complete all the mandatory Pre-placement requirements for this program. It will take up to 8 to 10 weeks to complete.
Students will need to process and provide proof of their
medical records
(such as TDAP shot, COVID-19, MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titres and Two-Step TB Skin Test), proof of clear
Vulnerable Sector Check
renewed every year
,
CPR level C certificate
renewed every year, annual flu shot and
mask fit test
renewed every two years. These requirements must be submitted by the program specific deadline to
ParaMed Placement Pass website
.
COVID-19 vaccination:
Public Health recommends that people working with young children and other vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  As such, students who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may not be able to complete the required field placement component of their program in the regularly scheduled time frame.
The health policies and non-academic requirements are designed to protect clients and vulnerable populations whom students will engage in practice. Students who do not comply with the program’s health policy and non-academic requirements, or who do not submit all required documentation by deadlines established by the program will be excluded from the clinical practicum. Exclusion from clinical practicum for any reason may jeopardize students' academic standing and successful completion of this program.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student.
To download the mandatory Pre-placement health form and for more details, go to the
Clinical Pre-placement website.
Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy (renew every year)
In compliance with requests from our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a Vulnerable Sector Check completed, and this check must be renewed every year before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered "vulnerable persons" under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the police record check covers appropriateness for "individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s)."
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a "clear" vulnerable sector check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a "not clear" status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment. The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
Pre-placement website
.
Program Selection Process
The selection of students involves a two-step procedure:
i) Eligible applicants will be invited to take an online admissions test involving subjects covering English, physics, anatomy, and workshop awareness.
Testing will be available during the months of March and April. Specific details, dates, and timing will be sent to qualifying applicants two weeks prior to the testing dates. Applicants will have 90 minutes to complete the admissions test.
Scheduling and arrangements for this testing will be done via the email applicants submitted when registering with Ontario Colleges.
ii) The top-ranked students from the admissions testing will be invited to an online video interview.
Approximately 30 of the highest rated online interviews will be selected for the first-year class beginning in September of each calendar year. The remaining qualifying applicants will be placed on a waitlist.

"The program is very, very hands-on. In addition to the academic side dealing with anatomy, pathology and biomechanics, we have two lab days per week where there's a full working shop. The program coordinators and all of the instructors are really passionate and very dedicated people. They really want to see you succeed.
I love the interaction that I get within the healthcare facility. But coupled with that, I get to work in a working shop. I get to build and put things together all day. We have a plaster room, a laminating room, a sewing room, a machine room with special sanders and grinders. I get to use all my own tools. God, it's great."
