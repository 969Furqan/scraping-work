Your Field Education Options
Work Experience (co-op or internship work term)
This program requires the successful completion of a one-semester work experience to graduate. This work experience is either co-op (paid) or internship (unpaid). Either one will give you the practical experience employers value. The work experience term occurs
between
the two academic semesters.
George Brown works with employers and industry partners to identify potential work experience opportunities. Students then apply for these opportunities and go through a competitive interview process. Students are also strongly encouraged to pursue self-directed industry work experience opportunities they believe will provide the learning experiences they value and meet the learning outcomes of the program. This valuable work experience can, in turn, be added to your resumé.
In addition to more formal on-the-job work experience, George Brown College endeavours to provide field education opportunities with real-world problems and clients. Find out more about

The Marketing Management - Financial Services program has given me a wholistic view of marketing, from traditional practices to digital strategies. The best part of the program was the co-op term, where I was able to gain experience which equipped me with important skills that are highly valuable in today's society. I highly recommend this program to those who want to learn not just about financial services, but about marketing as well.

The Marketing Management - Financial Services program has given me a wholistic view of marketing, from traditional practices to digital strategies. The best part of the program was the co-op term, where I was able to gain experience which equipped me with important skills that are highly valuable in today's society. I highly recommend this program to those who want to learn not just about financial services, but about marketing as well.
