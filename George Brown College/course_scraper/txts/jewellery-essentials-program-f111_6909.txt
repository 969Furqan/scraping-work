"The Jewellery Essentials program at George Brown College not only allowed me to develop transferable skills, but also an attention to detail that can only be found by working in such small scale. I came into the program without any knowledge on making jewellery and after only one year I feel the ways in which I can exercise my creativity are virtually limitless. I am truly thankful to have such a skilful and caring faculty teaching me about my passion."
