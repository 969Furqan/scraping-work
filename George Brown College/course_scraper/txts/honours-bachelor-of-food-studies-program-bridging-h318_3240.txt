This program provides the food leaders of tomorrow with the skills, insights and knowledge to succeed in the rapidly changing hospitality and culinary arts field. Graduates will be positioned to succeed in various food-related occupations, including culinary, education, tourism, recreation, health, food security, sustainability, economic development, agriculture, public policy and research. There are growing opportunities for careers informed by both culinary experience and versatile critical thinking.
