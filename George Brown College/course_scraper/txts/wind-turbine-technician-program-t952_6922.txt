Program Description
Program Overview
Prepare for a career in one of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the world with the Wind Turbine Technician certificate program. George Brown College created this online program to address a global need for people skilled in servicing, diagnosing, repairing and installing wind turbines and related equipment.
Using multimedia learning resources and cutting-edge simulation software, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of wind turbine power and control circuits.
Full Description
With online and on-demand delivery, the
Wind Turbine Technician (T952)
program provides a flexible and convenient option for adult learners to train for an exciting career while managing weekday work or family commitments.
Modelled on George Brown College’s other innovative online technical training programs, the Wind Turbine certificate program provides basic technician-level training through independent study. The average completion time is 32 weeks, but students can complete the program at their own pace.
Students will develop the skills needed for roles in the construction, installation, operation and maintenance of wind turbines and wind farms.
The program integrates theory with laboratory experiments and projects. It consists of 14 modules of interactive curriculum using text, video, 2D and 3D animations, photos, audio clips and state-of-the-art interactive electrical/electronic/PLC (programmable logic controller) simulations. Students will receive a licensed copy of CircuitLogix, including 2D and 3D simulation and PLCLogix 500.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
People trained in the wind turbine sector work in a variety of jobs with many different titles, including:
wind energy technician
wind turbine repair technician
wind turbine service technician
wind turbine technician
blade repair technician
Wind Turbine Technicians typically perform the following tasks
:
inspect the exterior and physical integrity of wind turbine blades and towers
climb wind turbine towers to inspect or repair wind turbine equipment
perform routine maintenance on wind turbines
test and troubleshoot electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic components and systems
replace worn or malfunctioning components
collect turbine data for testing or research and analysis
service underground transmission systems, wind farm substations, or fibre-optic sensing and control systems
Industry
Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing energy sources in the world. Wind energy supplies 10 per cent of all the electricity produced in the U.S. and five per cent in Canada. Global-installed wind-generation capacity, both onshore and offshore, has increased by a factor of 100 in the past two decades, jumping from 8.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2002 to 850 GW in 2023. To further expand wind energy’s capabilities and benefits to society, researchers are working to address technical and socio-economic challenges supporting a decarbonized electricity future.
A skilled workforce of wind technicians will be required for the construction, installation (commercial and industrial), operation and maintenance of wind farms.
