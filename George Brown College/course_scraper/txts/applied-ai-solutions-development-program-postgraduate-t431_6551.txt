Program Description
Leadership Claims
The Applied A.I. Solutions Development program is one of the first of its kind to be offered by a Canadian college. Developed by George Brown College’s School of Computer Technology, it recognizes the industry demand for full stack data scientists who are qualified to fill the roles of data scientist, data analyst, data engineer or machine learning engineer as needed, and also apply business analysis skills to effectively communicate how artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning can be used in business models.
Program Overview
In our innovative
Applied A.I. Solutions Development
one-year graduate certificate program, you’ll immerse yourself in a cross-disciplinary blend of computer science, mathematics and business, equipping you with the expertise to craft solutions across industries using artificial intelligence (A.I.), machine learning, deep learning and data science/analytics.
This unique program merges computer science, math and business with a design-thinking approach to produce machine-learning/deep-learning models and intuitive dashboards to communicate results and findings. As a student, you’ll also receive comprehensive training in tailoring your presentations to target audiences, including technical experts, business stakeholders and potential investors.
If you apply to the May 2025/26 intake for this program, you will start in May 2026.
Full Description
As we advance into this increasingly digital world, artificial intelligence and data science will revolutionize most industries by optimizing business processes and automating decision-making in many white-collar jobs. As a student in the
Applied A.I. Solutions Development
one-year graduate certificate program, you’ll gain the skills to provide existing businesses and emerging startups with the tools they need to thrive in the digital revolution.
This three-semester program uses a hands-on, applied approach to A.I., giving you the broad range of skills needed to excel in this booming industry.
We’ll teach you to develop and apply machine-learning/deep-learning models, giving you a fundamental understanding of the underlying mathematical algorithms that power them. This combination of knowledge and skills will allow you to identify and select algorithms for different uses, build and fine-tune models and communicate the resulting data – bridging the traditional roles of data scientist, machine-learning engineer and business translator.
Technology Requirements
This program requires you to have access to a personal computer with the following specifications:
8 GB minimum (16 GB RAM recommended
256 GB SSD Hard Drive (500+ GB is optimal)
quad-core i5/i7 2.4GHz or better
webcam
