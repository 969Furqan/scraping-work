Preparing graduates to work as Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocates for over 30 years.
This program is unique in Canada.
Program Overview
The
Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocate (AWCCA) (Accelerated)
program will prepare you to provide anti-oppressive counselling and advocacy for survivors of gender-based violence.
Apply to this accelerated program stream if you have an existing diploma or degree and work/volunteer experience in feminist organizations and programs and are interested in accelerating your career as a counsellor/advocate for survivors of gender-based violence.
To begin your studies in May 20206, apply to the 2025/26 intake for this program. To start this program in May 2025, apply to the 2024/25 intake.
Full Description
The
Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocate (AWCCA) (Accelerated) (C147)
diploma program will provide you with a feminist, anti-racist analysis of the political and counselling issues related to gender-based violence experienced primarily by self-identified women, children, trans and non-binary survivors.
This three-semester program is a condensed version of the two-year Assaulted Women's and Children’s Counsellor/Advocate (C137) program. It will provide you with a foundation to be an agent for change in community education, political action, and law reform. It will prepare you to provide anti-oppressive counselling for survivors who have experienced or are experiencing gender-based violence.
You will study the range of issues that impact and contribute to gender-based violence, such as social justice movements, privilege and oppression, violence in the digital world and more. You will have the chance to practise your newly learned counselling skills offsite with one of our field placement partners. See 'Your Field Education Options' for details.
To qualify for this three-semester, accelerated program, you must have an existing diploma or degree and work/volunteer experience in feminist organizations and programs and should be interested in working as a counsellor/advocate for survivors of gender-based violence.
Your Field Education Options
Field education plays an important role in this program by preparing you to work with those affected by gender-based violence, including the communities within which they live and work. This often includes those who identify as trans and non-binary, and other disenfranchised populations.
As a student in this accelerated program stream, you will begin your field placement in the Fall semester. You can expect to engage in front-line services such as one-on-one survivor counselling, group facilitation, case management and advocacy. Your placement experience will begin in September and continue through to the end of April for approximately 400 hours. Typical field placement settings include emergency shelters, rape crisis centres, youth services, health providers and other agencies that provide front-line support to survivors of gender-based violence.
The agencies used by the program for field placements are very similar to those employing our graduates. In many instances, employers hire graduates because of contact and experience with them through the fieldwork placement. Most agencies are within Toronto, while some agencies, located in other communities such as Brampton, St. Catharines, London, Hamilton, Barrie, Pickering and Oshawa, provide students who live in those communities with placement opportunities.
Note:
Some of our student placement partners require you to have a vulnerable sector screening completed before your field placement in semesters 3 and 4 of the program. These screenings can take up to four months to be processed, and are done to protect the clientele of these agencies, who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law. The fees for the reference checks vary and are, in most cases, paid by you. You are responsible for ensuring that the check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).” If you are unable to provide a clear screening, you will be assisted in finding a placement that meets your learning needs.
