Program Description
Leadership Claims
Preparing graduates to work as early childhood educators for more than 40 years.
Program Overview
George Brown's
Early Childhood Education Diploma program
will prepare you for a rewarding career in a rapidly evolving sector. In this online 16-month program stream, you will learn to work with children from six weeks to 12 years of age in a variety of early childhood education settings.
Full Description
This Early Childhood Education program is currently offering a $2,000 tuition grant to domestic students starting in January 2025.*
George Brown's
Early Childhood Education (C150)
Diploma program will give you the knowledge and practical experience you need to support children's learning as they grow. Learning online, you will study the holistic developmental needs of infants (from six weeks), toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children (to 12 years). You will learn how to design inclusive education and care programs and respond to the unique needs and interests of a child.
You will also engage with families and the broader community.
This program alternates between online classes and in-person field placement experiences to solidify your learning as you go. This integrated approach will help you develop confidence in your skills as you progress throughout the program and ensure you are ready to work immediately upon graduation.
Accelerated Online Option  (16 consecutive months)
If you are eager to enter the field and can study without significant breaks, apply to this online program stream that begins in January. You will complete your Early Childhood Education Diploma in just 16 consecutive months (four continuous semesters).
*This opportunity is funded in partnership with the
City of Toronto
,
the Region of Durham
,
the Region of Peel
, the Province of Ontario, and the Government of Canada under the new Canada-Ontario Early Childhood Workforce Agreement, which provides one-time federal funding to support the retention and recruitment of a high-quality child care and early years workforce.
Your Field Education Options
As a student in the Early Childhood Education program, you will complete a seven-week field placement each semester. Each field placement will be an in-person experience.
While in the field, you will have the opportunity to work with children of different age groups in a variety of settings. Field placement provides a continuum of experience that will give you an invaluable opportunity to integrate and apply classroom theory as you develop a hands-on practice.
For students studying online who live within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), you will have access to our George Brown child care facilities that model the best practices we consider essential. We are proud to operate Ontario's largest network of college-run lab school child care centres that serve over 1,000 children and their families each year. These
13 child care centres
, located across Toronto, will expose you to the kinds of environments where you will eventually work and also provide valuable services to the families and communities they serve.
For students studying online who live outside of the GTA, you will be supported to complete your field placements in or close to your local community.
Please note:
Many field placement partners may require you to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 (a person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose). As such, if you are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you may be unable to complete your program's required field placement component in the regularly scheduled time frame.
