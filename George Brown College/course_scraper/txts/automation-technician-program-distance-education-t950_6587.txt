Program Description
Program Overview
International Students
This online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and
does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.
We developed the 32-week
Automation Technician
certificate program to meet the industry’s growing demand for workers with a broad set of skills and knowledge in industrial automation, including digital electronics, process control, SCADA systems, and programming of Programmable Logic Controllers and robotics. This program examines applications and examples of automated manufacturing systems, including both the theory and function of digital and industrial electronics, hydraulics and pneumatics, robotics systems, programming languages and alarm management. You’ll learn through a combination of theory and laboratory simulations using LogixSim, a simulation software suite that includes electronics, PLC and robotics simulation.
Full Description
International Students
This online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and
does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.
The 32-week
Automation Technician
certificate program provides an introduction to industrial automation, including digital electronics, process control, SCADA systems and programming of PLCs, and robotics. The program examines applications and examples of automated manufacturing systems, including both the theory and function of digital and industrial electronics, hydraulics and pneumatics, robotics systems, programming languages and alarm management.
The learning materials, provided in a web-based downloadable file format, include 18 modules of interactive curriculum using text, 2D and 3D animations, photos, audio clips and interactive lab simulations. Interactive exercises, practice exams and online support will prepare you for computer-based final exams. We designed these flexible computer-based modules to fit into your schedule – not ours – so you can work at your own pace while you complete the program. The average completion time of the 18 training modules is 32 weeks, but there are no time limits.
One of the key features of our Automation Technician program is the integration of theory with lab projects. You'll receive a licensed copy of LogixSim, which includes both 2D and 3D simulation software and features CircuitLogix Pro, RoboLogix, PLCLogix 5000 and 3DLab simulation products. This software allows for the design, testing and debugging of control devices and automated equipment, as well as circuit schematics and systems. From the simplest control circuits to the most complex, LogixSim has the versatility to suit almost any requirement for real-world simulation.
