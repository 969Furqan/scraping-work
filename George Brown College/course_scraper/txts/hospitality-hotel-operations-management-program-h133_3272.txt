Program Description
Program Overview
Do you want to work in the vibrant global hotel and hospitality industry? Gain the knowledge and skills to launch a successful career with the
Hospitality – Hotel Operations Management
program.
Full Description
The two-year
Hospitality – Hotel Operations Management (H133)
diploma program prepares graduates for exciting careers in the hotel industry and other areas such as restaurants, convention centres, luxury retirement homes, entertainment complexes and more. You’ll study in downtown Toronto, surrounded by leading hospitality organizations.
You will learn about current and best practices in the following areas:
front office
food and beverage
marketing and sales
conferences and event planning
retirement homes
branded residences
country clubs
You will start building your resumé and professional network by completing a 14-week work-integrated learning experience with your choice of a Canadian or international placement. A hotel operations management simulation – part of a final capstone project – gives you the opportunity to show off your decision-making and critical-thinking skills. Students can also participate in a European study tour, visiting top hotels.
This program allows you to switch to any of our hospitality and tourism management diploma programs by your second year should your hospitality area of interest change. We also know life can be full of unexpected events; should you not be able to complete your final year of study, our common first-year model makes you eligible to graduate with a one-year certificate in
Hospitality Services (H101)
.
Note:
George Brown College has adopted a
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
initiative. As a result, we no longer have computer lab classrooms. For classes that require computers, students will need to bring their own laptops. Our Library Learning Commons offers
open access computers
as well as
equipment that can be borrowed
on a short-term basis. For more information, please contact The Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts at
chcastudentsupport@georgebrown.ca
Your Field Education Options
As part of your fourth semester, you will complete a 14-week industry externship with your choice of a Canadian or international placement. This opportunity will enhance your knowledge with real-world experience and help you start building your network. The Hotel Operations Management program will make you the kind of multi-talented graduate the local and international hotel industry seeks in today’s competitive environment.
Students gain the skills required to be progressive leaders within the industry, enriching the experience of hotel guests. You will receive industry certifications in food safety, responsible alcohol beverage service and first aid (CPR).
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities

With more than 38,000 hotel rooms and over 200 hotels in the Toronto area and counting, employment opportunities abound.

You can also explore a wealth of management career opportunities in restaurants, casinos, luxury retirement homes, cruise ships, convention centres, entertainment complexes, clubs, bed and breakfasts, catering companies and conference services.
