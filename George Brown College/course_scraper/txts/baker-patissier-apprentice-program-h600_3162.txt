Program Description
Program Overview
The
Baker/Patissier Apprenticeship
program is an excellent option if you want hands-on learning, flexibility and the freedom to earn while you learn. Study in downtown Toronto, surrounded by top bakeries, patisseries, chocolate shops, hotels and catering companies.
Full Description
Learn a skilled occupation by combining in-school learning and paid on-the-job training with the
Baker/Patissier Apprenticeship (H600)
program.
If you already have practical experience as a baker or patissier, you can:
build upon your work experience
experience hands-on training
learn the related theory in an innovative program that fits your work schedule
get the qualifications you need without taking a long-term absence from your job
Apprenticeship training is an agreement between a person wishing to learn a skill and an employer who can provide the environment for skills training. Administered by the Apprenticeship Client Services Branch of the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development (MLITSD), an apprenticeship is the best way to continue your journey on a promising career path. Upon completion, apprentices return to the industry more confident and with an updated skill set that prepares them for greater job opportunities.
There are three levels of in-school training (H600, H606 and H604) in our Baker/Patissier Apprenticeship program:
Level I: Learn fundamental baking theories and techniques and essential industry employability skills such as communications and mathematics. The hands-on courses include Fermentation, Cookies, Pastry and Ingredients.
Level II: Build your advanced baking skills and develop bakery management practices. The hands-on courses include Decoration, Cakes and Desserts.
Level III: Complete your in-school studies with hands-on practical courses to hone your skills as you work toward becoming a patissier. Reinforcing the skills learned in levels I and II, you will also experience Specialty Cakes, Petits Fours, Almond Paste, Gum Paste, Sugar Work and Chocolate.
You can earn your official Red Seal certification as a baker/patissier from the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development (MLITSD) by completing on-the-job and classroom training under the sponsorship of a registered employer.
