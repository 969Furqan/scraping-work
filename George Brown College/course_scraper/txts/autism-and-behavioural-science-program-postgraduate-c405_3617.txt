Program Description
Leadership Claims
Preparing Autism and Behavioural Science graduates for nearly 20 years.
Program Overview
The
Autism and Behavioural Science (Postgraduate)
program focuses on autism spectrum disorders and therapies, mainly applied behaviour analysis (ABA), with a primary application for children and adolescents. You will gain practical experience working with treatment teams.
Full Description
The one-year Autism and Behavioural Science (Postgraduate) (C405) program was developed in response to the growing public concern about services for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
It was designed to deepen the expertise in the field of autism and behavioural sciences for application within the children’s sector and simultaneously create a pool of qualified individuals to meet the needs of service agencies that provide autism or children’s services.
To qualify for this program stream, you must be a graduate with a university degree or college graduate who has studied early childhood education, social service worker, child and youth care, developmental service worker or similar program. In this program, you learn the
specialized skills
and
expertise
you need to work with individuals who have been diagnosed with autism.
Please note this program does not teach counselling or “talk therapy.” This is an intensive program designed to develop skills to work with Autistic individuals to create behaviour change by increasing skills and decreasing maladaptive behaviours.
As a student in the Autism and Behavioural Science program, you will study:
autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
intervention methods, including Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI)
applied behaviour analysis (ABA) theory (e.g., operant conditioning)
how to work with families and treatment teams
relevant legislation
Be advised that due to the number of opportunities for appropriate placements within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), you may be required to travel as far east as Oshawa, as far west as Burlington and as far north as Vaughan to complete your placement component.
Science-Based Program
As this is an intensive science-based program, please expect:
a heavy workload
complex, scientific terminology
to read and analyze scientific journal articles
Recommended Skills and Aptitudes:
To ensure your success in this program, we recommend:
advanced-level English skills required
caring
tenacious
analytic
detail-oriented
Autism and Behavioural Science Faculty
This program is taught by both full- and part-time professors who have extensive experience in ABA, IBI and ASD.
Connected to Industry
Our program is highly regarded in the sector. We have well-established relationships with agencies across the GTA who provide services for individuals with a diagnosis of autism.
Have a university degree?
If so, consider applying to the
Behavioural Science Technician Accelerated (C156) program
. This one-year program is similar to this program (e.g., a degree is required), with a few key differences:
university degree required
offers more depth in content to include a broader range of populations (other than just autism)
include two seven-week field placements
three-semester, one-year program
graduate with a diploma (vs. a certificate)
Your Field Education Options
George Brown's Autism and Behavioural Science program has been designed to provide you with meaningful hands-on experiences within settings where you could ultimately find work.
The field placement experience in semester 1 is three weeks long. During that time, you will visit an agency partner (e.g., ABA centre, school, residential home, daycare setting, etc.) to observe an individual with autism.
In semester 2, field placement is with an agency partner but seven weeks long. During that time you will observe an individual with autism and partake in various daily tasks such as indirect assessment, identification of target behaviours, and data collection.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
As a graduate of George Brown's Autism and Behavioural Science program, you will be prepared to work as an ABA instructor for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Typical settings include public agencies, group homes, schools and private family settings.
Upon graduating from this program, you may also have the opportunity to advance into a supervisor or consultant role.
If you have an existing diploma or degree, you may qualify for a broader range of career opportunities, such as:
resource teacher
educational assistant
program supervisor
Alumni Impact
We are immensely proud of the contributions of our alumni in Toronto and around the globe.
From Michelin-starred restaurants to major construction, entertainment, community and financial organizations, our graduates are truly making an impact across a range of industries.

Special Requirements
Clinical Pre-placement Health Form requirements and program policy
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet and complete all the mandatory Pre-placement requirements for this program. It will take up to eight to 10 weeks to complete.
Students will need to process and provide proof of their
medical records
(TDAP shot, MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titres and Two-Step TB Skin Test) and proof of clear
Vulnerable Sector Check
renewed every year. These requirements must be submitted by the program specific deadline to
ParaMed Placement Pass website
.
COVID-19 vaccination:
Public Health recommends that people working with young children and other vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. As such, students who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may not be able to complete the required field placement component of their program in the regularly scheduled time frame.
The health policies and non-academic requirements are designed to protect clients and vulnerable populations whom students will engage in practice. Students who do not comply with the program’s health policy and non-academic requirements, or who do not submit all required documentation by deadlines established by the program will be excluded from the clinical practicum. Exclusion from clinical practicum for any reason may jeopardize students' academic standing and successful completion of this program.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student. To download the mandatory Pre-placement health form and for more details, go to the
Clinical Pre-placement website.
Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy (renew every year)
In compliance with the requirements of our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a Vulnerable Sector Check completed, and this check must be renewed every year before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).”
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a “clear” Vulnerable Sector Check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a “not clear” status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment. The fees for the vulnerable sector check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
Clinical Pre-placement website.

"The Autism and Behavioural Science program absolutely
propelled
me into the fulfilling career of working to better the lives of those living with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Without this program at George Brown College, I am certain I would not have had the educational jump-start I was given to land me my first clinical position immediately upon graduation. What I valued most was the privilege to form the influential relationships that I did with the skilled professors already working within the field. I am grateful I chose to pursue this post-graduate certificate; it truly was the catalyst to a profession that I take great pride in every single day."
