Program Overview
This two-year program is eligible for
a $40,000 scholarship.
*
In the
Mechanical Technician – CNC and Precision Machining
two-year diploma program, you’ll dive into the world of precision machining and cutting-edge computer-controlled machine (CNC) technology. Our state-of-the-art labs, including Precision Machining, CAD/CAM, CNC, Research, and Robotics, will set you up with hands-on training and real-world skills. You’ll design and manufacture tools, jigs, fixtures, precision fabrication, assemblies and prototypes using computer-aided design and manufacturing software, precision machining equipment and sophisticated CNC machine tool technology. In your final year, you’ll enhance your learning through a 15-week co-op placement with industry partners.
*Domestic students only — see page for details.
Full Description
In the
Mechanical Technician – CNC and Precision Machining
two-year diploma program, you’ll benefit from a combination of advanced machine-tool technology principles (CAD/CAM/CNC) with extensive hands-on manufacturing practices. This unique mix of skills will set you up to meet the technical challenges you may face in the workplace. You’ll also get a boost to your technical training with courses in mathematics, communications and general education.
In your final year of this program, you’ll design and fabricate prototypes using digital manufacturing technology (laser cutters, 3D printers and multi-axis CNC machine tools).
Your Field Education Options
Students will complete a mandatory 15-week co-op term in Year 2 following the final semester of classroom studies.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
