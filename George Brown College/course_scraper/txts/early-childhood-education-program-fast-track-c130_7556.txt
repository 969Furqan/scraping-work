Program Description
Leadership Claims
George Brown College has been preparing graduates to work as early childhood educators for more than 40 years.
Program Overview
The
Early Childhood Education (Fast-Track)
program is for graduates with a diploma or degree in a related field. This fast-track stream will prepare you for a rewarding career working with children from six weeks to 12 years of age in a variety of early childhood education settings.
Full Description
The
Early Childhood Education (Fast-Track) (C130)
program is for graduates with a diploma or degree in a related field. In just two semesters (10 months, plus two weeks), you will study the holistic developmental needs of infants (from six weeks), toddlers, preschoolers and school-age children (to 12 years). You will learn to design inclusive education and care programming and develop skills to respond to a child's unique needs and interests.
You will also engage with families and the broader community.
To solidify your learning as you go, this program alternates between in-class learning and field placement experiences. This integrated approach not only helps you develop confidence in your skills as you progress throughout the program but will ensure you are ready to work immediately upon graduation.
Fast-Track Program Structure
This program starts in August and ends in June of the same year.
The structure of this Fast-Track program is as follows:
August: Program starts with a two-week orientation course
September–December: Semester 3 (includes one seven-week field placement)
January–April: Semester 4 (includes one seven-week field placement)
May–June: program concludes with one seven-week field placement
Your Field Education Options
As a student in this Early Childhood Education (Fast-Track) program you will complete three seven-week field placement experiences. The first will take place in semester 3, the second will take place during semester 4 and the third will start in May after your classroom studies have been completed. During this time, you will have the opportunity to work with children of different age groups in a variety of settings.
Field placement plays an important role in this ECE program as it provides a continuum of experience that gives you the chance to progressively build on your learning as you develop new skills and progress through the program.
To support your learning outcomes and ensure you have access to facilities that model the best practices we consider essential, we operate Ontario's largest network of college-run lab school child care centres that serve over 1,000 children and their families each year. These
13 child care centres,
located across Toronto, will not only expose you to the kinds of environments where you will eventually work but they also provide valuable services to the families and communities they serve.
Please note:
Many field placement partners may require you to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 (a person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the second dose). As such, if you are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you may be unable to complete your program's required field placement component in the regularly scheduled time frame.
