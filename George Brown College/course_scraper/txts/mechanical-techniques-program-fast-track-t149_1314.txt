Program Description
Program Overview
This 14-week
Mechanical Techniques
certificate program is specifically designed to complement university engineering students’ theoretical knowledge with applied practical techniques. Topics include manufacturing protocol, engineering drawing, solid modelling (Solidworks), precision machining, quality control, CNC machining with Mastercam, pneumatics/electro-pneumatic circuits and microprocessor control systems. Coursework emphasizes practical techniques through applied learning and hands-on lab activities.
Full Description
The 14-week
Mechanical Techniques
certificate program is specifically designed to introduce currently enrolled and recently graduated university engineering students to practical engineering concepts that include:
industrial safety
dimensional inspection
machining practices
metal forming
quality control
pneumatics/electro-pneumatic circuits
embedded electronics
Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM), and Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining techniques
Coursework will cover both theoretical and practical concepts with a focus on the lab-based application of course content.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Upon completion of the program, you will have a strong hands-on foundation in understanding the capabilities, limitations, applications and safe operation of machining tools and equipment.
The skills you gain through this fast-track certificate program relate directly to employer requirements for university engineering program theory, complemented by hands-on skills.
Alumni Impact
We are immensely proud of the contributions of our alumni in Toronto and around the globe.
From Michelin-starred restaurants to major construction, entertainment, community and financial organizations, our graduates are truly making an impact across a range of industries.
