The Honours Bachelor of Commerce (Culinary Management) program is the perfect balance of management and culinary skills. This four-year program prepared us for the industry so we could become strong leaders and skilled individuals. The way the program is built allowed us to create a strong foundation for the advanced courses we had throughout the years. We were able to learn every aspect of the hospitality industry not just the restaurant industry in these four- years. In the future, this will give the graduates a very flexible choice on their career path. The quality and academic levels of this program are of a very high standard, making this degree worth it. The knowledge of the professors and chefs we had in this program helped me to excel in my academic and culinary skills. The small class sizes were great because they allowed us to have a first-person connection to our professors. They all guided us and gave us extra help whenever we needed it. My favourite aspect of this program was the evolution it went through. From real-life case studies to the opportunity to create a business plan, we were always connected to the industry. The guest speakers we had in our courses helped us to get an insight into the industry we would be a part of. Even in our management classes, we were doing hands-on work like creating a business plan or solving current issues in our industry. Every year we knew what was happening in the industry, from sustainability to laws, to the cost of equipment. This connection became stronger when we had our externships in the first year and third year. When we came back from these externships, we were able to connect to our courses even more with the experience we gained in the real world. After graduating from this program, I feel ready and confident with the skillset and knowledge I gained. I am proud to be in the first group of graduates this program will have and I will always be grateful to all my professors for their constant support and guidance in our four-year journey.

The Honours Bachelor of Commerce (Culinary Management) program is the perfect balance of management and culinary skills. This four-year program prepared us for the industry so we could become strong leaders and skilled individuals. The way the program is built allowed us to create a strong foundation for the advanced courses we had throughout the years. We were able to learn every aspect of the hospitality industry not just the restaurant industry in these four- years. In the future, this will give the graduates a very flexible choice on their career path. The quality and academic levels of this program are of a very high standard, making this degree worth it. The knowledge of the professors and chefs we had in this program helped me to excel in my academic and culinary skills. The small class sizes were great because they allowed us to have a first-person connection to our professors. They all guided us and gave us extra help whenever we needed it. My favourite aspect of this program was the evolution it went through. From real-life case studies to the opportunity to create a business plan, we were always connected to the industry. The guest speakers we had in our courses helped us to get an insight into the industry we would be a part of. Even in our management classes, we were doing hands-on work like creating a business plan or solving current issues in our industry. Every year we knew what was happening in the industry, from sustainability to laws, to the cost of equipment. This connection became stronger when we had our externships in the first year and third year. When we came back from these externships, we were able to connect to our courses even more with the experience we gained in the real world. After graduating from this program, I feel ready and confident with the skillset and knowledge I gained. I am proud to be in the first group of graduates this program will have and I will always be grateful to all my professors for their constant support and guidance in our four-year journey.
