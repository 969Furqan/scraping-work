This program holds a very special place in my heart. It’s been amazing to reflect on all the skills I’ve gained and the incredible people I’ve met. I’ve felt truly supported and seen throughout my time at GBC and even after graduation. The continued support from my professors as I embarked on my alumni career journey has meant so much to me. I’m really going to miss being at GBC and wish I could do it all over again!
When I first started, I had already launched my brand, Inward, but my skills were quite basic—I could only sew with stretch fabrics and didn’t even know what a dart was. I had many ideas but struggled to bring them to life. I chose to invest two years into studying this craft because I believed it was the ideal amount of time to acquire the skills I needed without a prolonged commitment. By the end of my first semester, I was thrilled to sew a perfect pleated skirt, which felt like a huge achievement.
The program’s focus on essential skills and high standards for construction quality has been incredibly valuable. I’ve gained practical skills in illustration, drafting, and construction, and built strong connections with my teachers. It provided a safe and inspiring space to create. I’ve already recommended this program to many friends, and even though the time has flown by, it’s emotional to think about the end of this chapter. I highly recommend this program to anyone looking to develop their fashion skills in a supportive and dynamic environment.

The program’s focus on essential skills and high standards for construction quality has been incredibly valuable. I’ve gained practical skills in illustration, drafting, and construction, and built strong connections with my teachers. It provided a safe and inspiring space to create. I’ve already recommended this program to many friends, and even though the time has flown by, it’s emotional to think about the end of this chapter. I highly recommend this program to anyone looking to develop their fashion skills in a supportive and dynamic environment.
