Program Description
Program Overview
The School of Architectural Studies’ (SAS) three-year Architectural Technology program prepares students to develop into architectural technologists who play a key role in transforming architectural designs into technical construction documents and practical building solutions. This multi-year program equips students with a solid foundation in building design, construction methods, materials, building codes and regulations, sustainable practices, digital practices and software in CAD, digital project delivery, and 3D visualization as well as the latest digital technologies such as 3D laser scanning, digital photogrammetry and aerial reality capture using drones.
Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on studio projects, students develop technical skills in preparing drawings, specifications, cost estimates and other documentation required for residential, commercial, industrial and institutional building projects. The curriculum covers areas such as building science, project management, detailing, site planning and the integration of various building systems.
Graduates are trained to collaborate with architects, engineers, contractors and other professionals in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. They contribute to the design process, construction documentation, project coordination and on-site supervision. The program prepares students for entry-level roles such as architectural technologists, digital project delivery co-ordinators, junior designers, estimators and project coordinators in various roles within the architecture, engineering and construction industries, as well as government agencies, and related organizations, contributing to the successful execution of building projects from concept to completion.
Full Description
As our natural and built environments change, we need good design and technical solutions to better our world. In our three-year
Architectural Technology
advanced diploma program, you’ll gain practical skills in our interactive studios while using up-to-date equipment and software. We’ll give you the tools you need to work on projects ranging from new construction to alterations and renovations in the residential, commercial, industrial, and high-rise sectors of the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry.
This exciting program prepares you to apply the current practices of the AEC industry, including:
building design
environmentally conscious and sustainable design
materials, methods and components
sustainability
building codes and regulations
building science
practice management
specifications and documentation
cost planning
digital project delivery
digital technologies
computational design
Not only will you develop a solid knowledge base and technical understanding of how buildings are designed and made, you'll also learn about the digital tools, platforms and processes used in the industry, like Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD), Digital Project Delivery (DPD), Building Information Modelling (BIM) and 3D Visualization and Digital Modelling.
With your project-specific Studio courses, where you apply all your knowledge and skills to a large-scale project, you’ll practise one of the top skills industry leaders look for: collaboration. In Studios, you’ll work in teams within a simulated office environment to complete projects involving proposals, designs and construction documents for both new and existing facilities.
Note
: If you enrol in the program in January, you must complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year to continue into semester 3 in the fall.
Your Field Education Options
Upon completion of fourth semester, a Co-operative (co-op) Work Placement experience component in the Architectural Technology program is available for a selected number of students. The intake for this co-op program is limited, and all applicants must meet program criteria, will participate in a competitive process and final approval by the School of Architectural Studies academic department.
Those who enter the program will complete semester 5 from May to August, and co-op placement will take place from September to December. The sixth and final semester will be offered through a blend of in-class and online studies, allowing students to graduate in April of their final year of study. It will also allow students the opportunity to continue part-time work while completing their final semester of studies.
More details regarding the co-op program will be made available through the department and all interested students can attend a co-op information session in early December.

"I am thankful that George Brown College provided portfolio classes. Having a portfolio is something that a lot of industries stress over and I think this class has helped me a lot in preparation for the interviews I had to go through before graduating. I got my first job right after graduation working as an Architectural Technologist on the Design Team at Q4 Architects Inc. I had considered going into university instead of college but what interested me more is being able to have the hands-on application that is given to you in college."

"I am thankful that George Brown College provided portfolio classes. Having a portfolio is something that a lot of industries stress over and I think this class has helped me a lot in preparation for the interviews I had to go through before graduating. I got my first job right after graduation working as an Architectural Technologist on the Design Team at Q4 Architects Inc. I had considered going into university instead of college but what interested me more is being able to have the hands-on application that is given to you in college."
