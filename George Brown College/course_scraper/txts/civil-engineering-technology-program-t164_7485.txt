Program Description
Program Overview
The
Civil Engineering Technology
three-year advanced diploma program focuses on the planning, design and construction of roads, bridges, tunnels, subdivisions, buildings, municipal services and heavy infrastructure. You’ll learn how to ensure that projects are functional and economical, while meeting standards and codes. Enjoy learning through a blend of lectures, labs and tutorials, with a focus on real drawing sets. You’ll also have the option to complete a co-op after your fifth semester.
Full Description
As a student in the
Civil Engineering Technology
three-year advanced diploma program, you’ll learn about:
Designing reinforced concrete structures, storm, water and sanitary systems, roads and steel-framed structures.
Interpreting construction drawings and specifications for various types of projects through extensive practical training from project drawing sets.
Estimating, bidding, scheduling and managing/supervising projects using the latest software.
Health and safety, site management and quality management on construction sites.
Risk analysis and value analysis for construction projects.
Legal aspects of construction, including types of contracts used in the industry.
Using business management techniques to pre-qualify projects based on expected returns, to create and manage a construction company and to understand its financial statements.
*If you enroll in the program in January, you are required to complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year in order to continue into semester 3 in the fall.
Your Field Education Options
Students are encouraged to secure summer employment in the civil and construction sectors. This summer fieldwork reinforces and extends the classroom training.
The Industry Liaison Office helps students connect with industry for field experience opportunities.
Co-op is offered after semester 5 to eligible students. Co-op placement term is 8–12 months. The students selected for co-op go for placement in the winter semester after completing semester 5 and do their semester 6 in the following winter semester when they return from their co-op.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Upon graduating from this program, you’ll have developed skills related to the design, construction and maintenance of civil infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, tunnels, heavy industrial buildings, rail and transit, storm, sanitary and water systems).
As a graduate, you’ll be prepared for employment in a wide variety of organizations such as government agencies (municipalities, Ministry of Transportation, Metrolinx, Infrastructure Ontario, etc.), contractors, sub-contractors, developers, engineering consulting firms, construction quality-control companies, cement and other construction materials manufacturing facility, aggregate quarries, surveying companies, concrete plants and asphalt plants. Roles within these firms may include:
structural design assistant
field engineer assistant
water resources technologist
project planner/scheduler
estimator for civil works
project monitor
construction materials quality control specialist
municipal engineering technologist
municipal inspector
project permits and approvals clerk
transportation engineering technologist
civil CAD/BIM technician
Industry
Canada’s civil construction industry is essential to the prosperity of the nation through infrastructure projects such as highways, roads, bridges, tunnels, rail and transit, water supply, stormwater management and wastewater treatment. With a growing population and an economy set to rebound, there are many opportunities for graduates in civil engineering technology.
Educational Pathways
Qualified graduates are eligible to bridge into the
Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) (T317) degree program
. For more information, see Diploma to Degree page. Additional future study options are available for individual graduates at various universities.
Alumni Impact
We are immensely proud of the contributions of our alumni in Toronto and around the globe.
From Michelin-starred restaurants to major construction, entertainment, community and financial organizations, our graduates are truly making an impact across a range of industries.
