Full Description
The three-year
Computer Systems Technology (Online)
advanced diploma program is designed with extensive industry input and offers two optional specializations in its third year:
The Networking specialization
focuses on network security, voice-over-IP (VoIP) and wireless LANs.
The Systems specialization
focuses on mail server administration, content management systems (Collaboration), database administration and computer security.
Both specializations include core courses on infrastructure virtualization (through the VMWare IT Academy) and cloud computing, as well as best practices in Information Technology (IT).
You’ll also be involved in real-life projects or case studies in your third year. You can complete these independently with an industry partner or George Brown’s Office of Research and Innovation. This hands-on experience may include working in teams to develop proposals, plan, set schedules and achieve specific goals in information technology. Through some of these exciting projects, our students have helped develop IT solutions for hospitals, large corporations and major IT and telecommunications service providers, including Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications, Cogeco Data Systems and many other well-known companies in the GTA.
This program covers all official Cisco CCNA Routing & Switching curriculum courses. The curriculum also prepares students to write several other examinations leading to industry certifications, such as the Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) and Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate.
Our college continues to invest in up-to-date networking, wireless, radio frequency, VoIP and security lab equipment so that all students gain hands-on experience installing and configuring equipment ranging from small offices to enterprise-class hardware and software. Cisco recognized this investment, along with the hands-on teaching environment, and designated George Brown as an Area Support Centre and Instructor Training Centre, making us part of a select group of Cisco Networking Academies in Canada.
Note:
Students who start the program in January (winter term) will be required to attend classes during the summer months (May to August).
