Program Description
Leadership Claims
George Brown College was the first college in Toronto to offer the Behavioural Science Technology advanced diploma and spearheaded the development of the Provincial Autism and Behavioural Science programs.
We have been providing training and education in Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) in Toronto for over 15 years.
Program Overview
The
Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis (S303)
is an accelerated degree program stream that will give you a comprehensive understanding of behavioural psychology and, more specifically, applied behaviour analysis (ABA). Apply to this stream if you have successfully completed two years of an approved behavioural science technology or technician program. This five-semester program starts with a spring/summer bridging semester that leads into year three (or semester 5) of the four-year degree.
To start your studies in May 2026, apply to the May 2025/26 intake for this program. To begin your studies in May 2025, apply to the 2024/25 academic year.
Full Description
The
Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis (S303)
is a fast-track degree program that
takes an in-depth look at applied behaviour analysis (ABA)—a field of study that uses a systematic and analytical approach to modify behaviour in a desirable way.
Apply to this program stream if you have completed two years of a behavioural science technology advanced diploma program with a minimum GPA of 3.0 or graduated from a behavioural science technician diploma program with a minimum GPA of 3.0.
You will complete a bridge semester during the spring/summer (semester 4) and will then join the third year (semester 5) of the four-year degree program.
ABA is an effective practice that is often used with populations who have:
autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
brain injury
dementia
developmental disabilities
addiction
mental health disorders
What you will be studying:
Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) is a scientific approach to the treatment and understanding of human behaviour. This approach can be applied to the entire range of human behaviour (i.e., thoughts, feelings and actions). Research has shown that an evidence-based approach such as ABA is most effective at decreasing problem behaviour and developing a variety of skills.
PLEASE NOTE: ABA differs from clinical psychology- a treatment approach that relies on talk therapy among other techniques.
The ABA approach involves three main components:
Component 1: A complete behavioural assessment
is conducted. A variety of interview and observational techniques are used to gain an understanding of the behaviour to be changed. You will learn how to observe and analyze behaviour in a variety of situations in order to develop an effective treatment strategy.
Component 2:
The next step is to
use the results of the behavioural assessment to develop an effective plan
that will reduce specific problem behaviours and develop or strengthen cognitive and behavioural skills. You will learn a variety of behavioural and cognitive behavioural techniques that can be used to change behaviour.
Component 3:
The final phase is an
ongoing evaluation of components one and two.
You will learn how to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, and continue to refine and revise their interventions based on the results of these measures.
RESEARCH COMPONENT
A foundational aspect of this degree lies in the research component of the program. During semesters 5 and 6, you will learn how to prepare an applied research proposal. The actual research will be conducted during the fall semester of the fourth year. You will receive faculty support throughout the entire process.
ABAI VERIFIED COURSE SEQUENCE
The Association for Behavior Analysis International has verified the following courses toward the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Behavior Analyst® or Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst® examination. Applicants will need to meet additional eligibility requirements and demonstrate they reside in an authorized country and province [Canada] before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination.
Please note
: The Association for Behaviour Analysis International (ABAI) has advised that the current Verified Course Sequence (VCS) approval system will expire on January 1, 2026. This means that the approved Verified Course Sequence (VCS) for this program will be valid until Dec 31, 2025. We are currently reviewing alternate ABAI accreditation options within their new Tiered Model of Education and will update this page when more information is available.
For details about the changes in Ontario, please visit the
College of Psychologists of Ontario
and review this document issues by the
Behaviour Analyst Certification Board
.
PREPARING FUTURE LEADERS
In addition to preparing you to become a practising behaviourist, this degree program will help prepare you to become a leader in this emerging field. Not only will you be supported in becoming a client-centred clinician, but you will also have the opportunity to learn the skills to advance behaviour analysis from a system-wide perspective, to support large-scale changes in agencies, organizations and government.
Graduates of our Behavioural Science programs are leaders of behavioural treatment in fields as varied as forensic mental health, autism spectrum disorder and acquired brain injury.
This intensive program, delivered on-site at George Brown's state-of-the-art Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences at Waterfront Campus, is suitable if you are data-driven, enjoy analyzing patterns and like to work with challenging behaviours.
The program's core courses are focused on five areas of learning:
behavioural science theories, principles and methods
special populations
psychology
research methods/statistics
ethics, professionalism and leadership
As of July 2024, the profession of applied behaviour analysis in Ontario will come under the jurisdiction of the newly expanded College of Psychologists and Behaviour Analysts of Ontario.
Your Field Education Options
While classroom theory is a very important part of your learning experience, we believe that field placement plays a critical role in solidifying that experience because it lets you practice your skills in a real-world environment.
You can expect to participate in block field placement in semester 6. Between semesters 6 and 7 (between years three and four), you will complete one 14-week field experience term (unpaid), during which you will be expected to conduct a research thesis.
Prior to starting the field experience term, a field co-ordinator will help you:
explore your interests
prepare for interviews
facilitate interview meetings by providing feedback
While in your placement setting, you will obtain support from the agency on-site supervisor as well as support from a college faculty field liaison.

Special Requirements
Clinical Pre-placement Health Form requirements and program policy
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet and complete all the mandatory Pre-placement requirements for this program. It will take up to eight to 10 weeks to complete.
Students will need to process and provide proof of their
medical records
(TDAP shot, MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titres and Two-Step TB Skin Test) and proof of clear
Vulnerable Sector Check
renewed every year. These requirements must be submitted by the program specific deadline to
ParaMed Placement Pass website
.
COVID-19 vaccination:
Public Health recommends that people working with young children and other vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. As such, students who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may not be able to complete the required field placement component of their program in the regularly scheduled time frame.
The health policies and non-academic requirements are designed to protect clients and vulnerable populations whom students will engage in practice. Students who do not comply with the program’s health policy and non-academic requirements, or who do not submit all required documentation by deadlines established by the program will be excluded from the clinical practicum. Exclusion from clinical practicum for any reason may jeopardize students’ academic standing and successful completion of this program.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student. To download the mandatory Pre-placement health form and for more details, go to the
Clinical Pre-placement website.
Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy (renew every year)
In compliance with the requirements of our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a Vulnerable Sector Check completed, and this check must be renewed every year before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).”
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a “clear” vulnerable sector check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a "not clear" status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment. The fees for the vulnerable sector check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit
Clinical Pre-placement website.

Special Requirements
Clinical Pre-placement Health Form requirements and program policy
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet and complete all the mandatory Pre-placement requirements for this program. It will take up to 8 to 10 weeks to complete.
Students will need to process and provide proof of their
medical records
(TDAP shot, MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titres and Two-Step TB Skin Test) and proof of clear
Vulnerable Sector Check
renewed every year. These requirements must be submitted by the program specific deadline to
ParaMed Placement Pass website
.
COVID-19 vaccination:
Public Health recommends that people working with young children and other vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  As such, students who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may not be able to complete the required field placement component of their program in the regularly scheduled time frame.
The health policies and non-academic requirements are designed to protect clients and vulnerable populations whom students will engage in practice. Students who do not comply with the program’s health policy and non-academic requirements, or who do not submit all required documentation by deadlines established by the program will be excluded from the clinical practicum. Exclusion from clinical practicum for any reason may jeopardize students' academic standing and successful completion of this program.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student. To download the mandatory Pre-placement health form and for more details, go to the
Clinical Pre-placement website.
Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy (renew every year)
In compliance with the requirements of our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a Vulnerable Sector Check completed, and this check must be renewed every year before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered "vulnerable persons" under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for "individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s)”.
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a "clear" vulnerable sector check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a "not clear" status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment. The fees for the vulnerable sector check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit
Clinical Pre-placement website.
