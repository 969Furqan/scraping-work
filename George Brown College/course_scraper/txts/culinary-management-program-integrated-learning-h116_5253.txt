Program Description
Program Overview
Get the skills and real-world experience to succeed in the culinary industry with the
Culinary Management (Integrated Learning)
program. This two-year diploma program blends in-class learning with industry placements, so you’re ready to hit the ground running at graduation.
Full Description
We created the Culinary Management (Integrated Learning) (H116) program to meet industry demand for highly skilled graduates with real-world kitchen experience who understand important culinary trends like the use of local foods, nutrition and the growing international influence. Students work toward a Culinary Management (Integrated Learning) diploma in four consecutive semesters. While this program is designed to deliver the same learning outcomes as
Culinary Management (H100)
, your third and fourth semesters are integrated directly with industry.
If you’re self-motivated with a strong desire to increase your employability at graduation, this program is for you.
Here’s what you’ll learn:
First semester – Fundamental culinary skills and theories required to work in a modern kitchen and essential industry employability skills such as communications and mathematics for hospitality.
Second semester – Advanced culinary skills and broadened food, wine and culinary culture knowledge; field placement preparation.
Third semester – Participate in a residency at George Brown College operations, The Chefs' House restaurant or The Café, where you will work alongside emerging top talent while serving a public of discerning urban diners. This experience runs at the same time as in-class and online theory-based courses to support your learning and development.
Fourth semester – Participate in an integrated 14-week residency with one of our leading culinary and hospitality industry partners. This experience runs at the same time as online theory-based courses. Online asynchronous learning allows for either local or international placements.
Program Schedule
The Culinary Management (Integrated Learning) program currently operates from Monday to Friday. Note: Some classes may begin at 7 a.m., and others may run until 10 p.m.

In the fourth semester, you will complete your studies with an integrated 14-week industry mentor/externship at one of our leading culinary and hospitality industry partners, concurrent with online theory-based courses.
