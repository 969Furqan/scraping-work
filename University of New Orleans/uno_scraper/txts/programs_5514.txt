Bachelor of Science in Business Administration
In today’s ever-changing economy, jobs and the need for certain talents evolve quickly. The successful businessperson therefore has to be a knowledgeable generalist as well as a field-specific expert. The UNO’s Bachelor of Science degree in business administration will train you to be both. Since you’ll complement your business curriculum with a substantial number of courses in liberal arts, you’ll become the flexible, innovative thinker companies look for (or the creative, ground-breaking entrepreneur should you go it alone).
For more information about this major download the printable degree requirements. If a major in business administration isn't for you, see about business administration as a minor (available for non-business majors only).
