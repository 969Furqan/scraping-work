Undergraduate Program
Computer Science B.S.
UNO’s Computer Science program offers a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and follows the guidelines of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). All CS majors will get hands-on programming experience, learn fundamental software design principles, and the use industry standard tool chains. CS majors have access to a number of research opportunities or paid internships and apprenticeships through our many industry partners. Our program has diverse course offerings in Artificial Intelligence, Database Administration, Computer Networking, Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Game Development, Mobile Applications, Web frameworks, Computer Forensics, Bioinformatics, Computer Graphics, and much more. With this superb training, our graduates are well prepared to enter the tech industry or admission into graduate school.

Objectives & Outcomes
Degree Requirements
Students develop analytical and creative skills which enable them to pursue careers within the tech industry. The program starts with necessary foundations for computational thinking such as decomposition, abstraction, modeling, iterative design, stepwise refinement, and basic software design principles. It culminates in a capstone design course in which a small team of students designs a software system of their choosing.

Accelerated Master's (AM)
The Accelerated Master’s Degree offers the opportunity for outstanding students to begin earning credit toward a master's degree while still pursuing undergraduate studies. Our accelerated programs allow a student to complete a master's in less time and at a lower cost.
Master's Degree Options
Students in AM may select from two different MS programs:
Computer Science
Cybersecurity
Minimum Requirements
Students must have a cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 3.2. Students may not enroll in graduate courses until they have:
completed all requirements for the Core Curriculum
completed a minimum of 75 hours of undergraduate work with at least 15 hours of upper-level courses completed in the major
been conditionally admitted to a master’s program.

Accelerated Master's Program
Minor
An undergraduate student may earn a minor in Computer Science by completing 18 credit hours of courses, each with a grade of C or better, from the list below:
CSCI 2120:
Software Design & Development in Java - II
CSCI 2125
:
Data Structures
CSCI 2450
:
Assembly Programming
CSCI 3301
:
Computer Organization
CSCI 4xxx:
4000-level elective computer science course
(3cr.)
CSCI 4xxx
:
4000-level elective computer science course
(3cr.)
Note: Credit in CSCI 1583 is required for CSCI 2120. Credit or concurrent enrollment in MATH 3721 is required for CSCI 2125. A transfer student must complete a minimum of nine credit hours in required computer science courses at UNO, and these must include CSCI 2125 and a three credit 4000-level course from the approved list.
Honors
An honors program is available to Computer Science majors. Successful completion of the program will result in graduation with Honors in Computer Science. To be eligible for admission to the program, a student must complete Computer Science 2125 and must have a faculty member willing to serve as thesis advisor.
In order to complete the program a student must do the following:
fulfill all graduation requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science;
maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 or better and a grade point average of 3.5 or better in computer science courses;
earn six credits in Computer Science 3099;
produce a written honors thesis and conduct an oral defense before a committee consisting of the faculty thesis advisor, at least one other faculty member selected by the department chairman, and a representative of the Honors Program.
