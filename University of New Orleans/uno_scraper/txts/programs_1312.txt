Pre-Allied Dental Fields
Allied dental fields include Dental Hygiene and Dental Laboratory Technology. A student planning to enter either of these two programs should contact the Office of Student Affairs at the LSU School of Dentistry during his or her first semester at UNO for detailed information about the programs including admission requirements. Both programs involve competitive admission with each program determining its own admission requirements. Upon completion of the degree requirements for either of the programs, the institution itself, not UNO, awards the degree. Additional information about the pre-allied dental fields may be obtained in the office of the College of Sciences (1100 Science Building).
