Bachelor of Arts in History
A Bachelor of Arts in history from the University of New Orleans will give you the tools to make sense of our past, gain a deeper understanding of the present, and help to shape a better course for our future. You’ll be immersed in the practice of historical studies, starting with foundational knowledge of historical eras and narrowing down to a focus area of your choice. By learning about the historical narratives that we construct as a people, you’ll see how critically interpreting those narratives can shift our perspectives of the world and our place in it.
During your studies, you’ll learn all about the historical research process: combining primary and secondary sources, evaluating evidence, identifying biases, interpreting contradictory or incomplete information, and so much more. These skills—along with a heightened ability to communicate your ideas—will serve you well in any field you choose. With a bachelor’s degree in history from UNO, you’ll have everything you need to understand our past and build your own future.

The B.A. in history will leave you well equipped for a future career as a historian, an educator, an archivist, a museum curator, or any number of other paths.
