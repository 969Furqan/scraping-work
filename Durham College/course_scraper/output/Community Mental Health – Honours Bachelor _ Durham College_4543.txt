Program Overview
The National Mental Health Institute estimates that by the age of 40, one in two Canadians will have experienced mental illness. As the demand for mental health services continues to rise, the need for qualified practitioners is becoming more vital than ever.
Through a comprehensive mix of theoretical, research and applied courses, students will apply their knowledge in a mandatory 14-week, 420-hour experiential work placement, bridging the transition from the classroom to real-world experience. Graduates will be equipped with the knowledge and concrete skills to successfully enter community mental health roles in areas such as case management, crisis counselling, mental health promotion, addictions counselling, housing and advocacy consultancy, peer support, and residential youth work.
