Program Details
The Community Integration through Co-operative Education (CICE) program is designed for individuals with intellectual disabilities or significant learning challenges. The CICE program is a great opportunity to build confidence, gain independence and enjoy the college experience first-hand. Students will learn at their own pace in a variety of college academic courses.
The CICE program provides students with an opportunity to enhance academic and vocational skills by taking college classes modified to fit academic abilities.
Students will receive support including:
Curriculum modification
Note taking
Tutoring
Other related support as needed
Learning facilitators will also provide students with support in the classroom and through a weekly tutorial. No additional support is provided outside of these academic settings.

Field placement experiences (unpaid) which enable the student to develop vocational abilities are an integral part of the CICE program. Successful completion of all courses and the field placement requirement will result in students graduating with an Ontario College Certificate in CICE.
