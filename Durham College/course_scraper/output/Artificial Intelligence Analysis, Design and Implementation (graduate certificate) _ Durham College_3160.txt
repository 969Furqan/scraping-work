Applied Research:
Students will have the opportunity to engage in applied research with the Durham College Hub for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence for Business Solutions, better known as the AI Hub.
Capstone projects:
All students will complete two diverse capstone projects – one per semester – to apply their classroom learning to tangible, real-world challenges. In the first, they will use strategy games as a foundation to teach an AI system (an agent in AI terms) to operate in a complex environment and achieve strategic goals. In the second, students will work with bleeding edge Deep Learning algorithms and frameworks to build upon concepts exercised in their first capstone. This will allow them to tackle highly complex problems with more advanced solutions.​
Optional work term:
Students who meet all academic requirements will be eligible to pursue an optional work term in a formal work environment or entrepreneurial endeavor. Entrance to the work term option is limited, and the processes for securing a work term position are competitive. The work term will be similar in length to an academic semester and typically involves full-time work hours that may be paid or unpaid.
Participating in the optional work term semester is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations.
Students in the Artificial Intelligence Analysis, Design and Implementation graduate certificate program will be invited to apply to the optional work term semester during their first academic semester. Entrance to the optional work term semester is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive. Students who qualify for the optional work term semester will be eligible to complete a four-month, paid work term after academic semester 2.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with work term students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions.
