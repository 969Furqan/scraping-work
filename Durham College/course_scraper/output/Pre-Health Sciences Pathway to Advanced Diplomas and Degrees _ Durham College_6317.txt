Program Details
The Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees (PHSU) program is designed to provide students with the core knowledge, skills and abilities fundamental to academic success in health sciences programs such as the collaborative Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) program delivered by Durham College and the Ontario Tech University (Ontario Tech), as well as other science-related programs at the advanced diploma or degree level.  This two-semester program is specifically designed for individ
uals who would like to develop their knowledge and skills in communications, mathematics, biology, general and organic chemistry,
physics
or critical thinking so they are well-prepared for the
rigours
of their next academic program. In addition, the program provides students with the opportunity to learn about potential careers in the health sciences and
identify
other programs focusing on the biological or chemical sciences that will enable them to achieve their career
objectives

PLEASE NOTE:
Successful completion of the PHSU certificate does not guarantee admission into Ontario Tech or other post-secondary programs.
The January intake of the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees program may not line up with university application deadlines for a fall start. Students must be sure to check the website for application deadlines at the institution to which they intend to apply.
Each educational institution determines its own admission requirements, so students must ensure that the courses they take meet the admission requirements at the institution(s) to which they intend to apply.
Individual academic planning assistance is offered by the student advisor and students are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor before selecting their courses or applying for transfer credit. Some Pre-Health Sciences Pathway courses are also transferable to other post-secondary programs.
