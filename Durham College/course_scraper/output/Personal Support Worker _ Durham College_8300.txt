Program Overview
Personal hygiene, mobility, preparing meals and taking essential medication are elements of daily life that most people take for granted, but there are many individuals who are unable to perform these tasks independently. The personal support worker (PSW) is the front-line care provider whose responsibilities focus on the provision of personal care and support that include activities of daily living with client populations across all institutional, community care and service settings. PSWs provide compassio
nate, client-
centred
care to enhance and
maintain
the quality of everyday life.
This program combines classwork, lab simulations and hands-on experience through work practicums in the community so our students are well-prepared and job-ready when you graduate.
