Program Overview
From recruitment and selection to training and development, a career in human resources (HR) requires a focus on both strategy and people. Skill, knowledge and ability in human resource planning, occupational health and safety, compensation, hiring, employee development, labour relations and managerial accounting enable HR professionals to contribute to business success in an increasingly competitive global marketplace, while looking after an organization’s most important asset – its employees.
WEEKEND DELIVERY FORMAT
The weekend delivery format is tailored for students who wish to study full-time without attending traditional weekday in-person classes. All classes will be conducted fully online on Friday evenings, Saturday, and Sunday. Please note that the Mental Health First Aid certification course may require a class time outside this schedule due to class size limitations and instructor availability. Additionally, there are self-directed (asynchronous) learning hours.
