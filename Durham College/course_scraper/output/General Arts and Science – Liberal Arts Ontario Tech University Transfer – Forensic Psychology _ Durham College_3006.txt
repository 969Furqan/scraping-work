Program Details
This two-semester General Arts and Science Liberal Arts Ontario Tech University Transfer pathway is designed for individuals interested in pursuing studies in Ontario Tech’s Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Forensic Psychology.
Students will refine essential academic skills and develop the foundational knowledge needed to help ensure success in subsequent post-secondary studies. Students will strengthen their critical thinking and communication skills, while also increasing their knowledge of the social sciences (particularly with respect to psychology) and familiarizing themselves with the rigors and opportunities of post-secondary life.
Students will be required to complete six courses per semester (12 courses in total). Topics and subject areas include academic preparation, critical thinking, computer skills, communications, psychology and sociology, among others.

The student advisor offers individual academic planning assistance; students are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor before selecting courses. Some General Arts and Science courses are also transferable to other post-secondary programs.
