Program Details
With more than 50 percent of your time spent in experiential learning opportunities in the labs and fields of the W. Galen Weston Centre for Food (Weston Centre), you will gain a unique hands-on opportunity to become familiar with the concepts that are critical to the food and agricultural industry, all within the context of a field-to-fork philosophy. You will learn in our fields, greenhouses, hoop house and state-of-the-art food chemistry and processing labs while planning for, planting, tending to and harvesting more than 50 varieties of produce, berry bushes, herbs and more.
By developing your own value-added food products, you will have a greater knowledge and understanding of the opportunities that come with food production. Whether you are interested in a career with a food company, managing a food operation, developing your own food product or owning a greenhouse or production farm, you will gain critical skills in modern farming concepts, food processing and food preservation to position you as an industry leader.
The Food and Farming program will offer you a hands-on opportunity to become familiar with the concepts of food production.
You will focus on the following:
Plant propagation
Soil and plant nutrition
Fruit and vegetable production under field, greenhouse, garden and container conditions
Food chemistry and analysis
Food product development
Food processing, including niche processing of local foods
Food and agriculture regulations
Food safety and microbiology
Disease and pest management
Business practices including product branding, entrepreneurship and marketing.
The program is offered at the college's Whitby campus, home of the W. Galen Weston Centre for Food. This incredible learning environment includes orchards, agricultural fields, greenhouses, food labs and more. Students also utilize the specialized laboratories at the 'Oshawa campus and participate in program-specific field trips throughout the academic year.
Students also have an opportunity to contribute to projects connected to the Barrett Centre of Innovation in Sustainable Urban Agriculture. This unique centre is focused on advancing knowledge, opportunities and activities that will lead to greater sustainable urban farming activities in communities throughout Ontario and beyond.
Please note: students will be required to purchase green tag safety boots in order to participate in many laboratory settings.
Each summer, many students are selected for paid work opportunities in the fields and grounds of the Weston Centre. This allows them to build on the learning from their first year and take part in legacy projects.
Durham College's recently announced partnership with The Barrett Family Foundation will support the creation of a centre of excellence and a new urban farm in Durham Region. The
Barrett Centre of Innovation in Sustainable Urban Agriculture
will become an internationally recognized hub of excellence in urban agriculture practices, research, education and training, creating several new opportunities for students.
