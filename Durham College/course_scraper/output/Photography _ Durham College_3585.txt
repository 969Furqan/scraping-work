Program Details
This program is focused on providing a balance of still and motion to meet the needs of a changing photography industry.

Students are required to purchase a digital camera in order to complete the course work and assignments in the Photography program. Please see the below suggested cameras. The hardware, software and photographic equipment used in this program are needed to teach the advanced technology skills required in the workplace.
Media Equipment Loans in the School of Media, Art & Design (MAD) have an inventory of accessories available for students enrolled in this program including:

Variety of specialty lenses made by Canon
Please note: the lenses will only fit Canon cameras so this should be a consideration when choosing your camera. MAD does not stock any lenses other than Canon for student lending.
Important Notice
Due to supply chain issues it is advised you purchase your camera well in advance of the fall start up
As you begin to prepare for college, we wanted to inform you of a special membership program with Canon Canada that allows you to shop at any authorized dealer for the best price and get discounts as a member of the
Canon Student Advantage Program
Membership gives students discounts on the dealer's best pricing for eligible equipment, at time of purchase.  For complete details, please visit Canon Canada's website.  For example, a member of the program gets an additional $125 discount on the Canon EOS R8 Body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens. Pricing and discounts are subject to change. Please see Canon's site for details.
There are three recommended models of mirrorless cameras that you may consider and each will meet the academic requirements of your program.
Our professors have extensive professional experience and recommend the Canon EOS R8 body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens and change the price to (Retail $1,999) as ideal for incoming students.  Designed with advanced features and functions, this camera meets all the needs and expectations for this program. Students will seamlessly integrate into the workforce upon graduation, armed with the same tool used by many of our industry partners.
Alternatively, students may wish to purchase a more entry level camera for those who are budget minded. Our professors recommend the Canon EOS RP body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens (Retail: $1,399).  Although this camera costs less it will still give students the opportunity to meet the needs of the program.
Alternatively, students may wish to purchase a more professional camera with better low light performance and all round quality. Our professors recommend the Canon EOS R6 MKII body with the kit lens W/RF 24-105mm IS STM Lens (Retail: $3,199). Although this camera costs more money, it will perform better, exceeding the demands of the program.

Experiential Learning
As part of their program, Photography students work directly with real industry clients, including not-for-profit and community organizations, on a variety of projects. Doing so provides students with access to real-time coaching and feedback from their professors.
The Photography program at Durham College has partnered with several not-for-profit community groups, including Spinal Cord Injury – Ontario; Canadian Adaptive Snowsports; Ontario Neurotrauma; Time4Change (Youth Without Shelter); Oshawa Fire Services and many corporate clients. These opportunities allow students to work directly with clients in the “real-world
”,
promote teamwork, and test those vital soft skills necessary to succeed.
