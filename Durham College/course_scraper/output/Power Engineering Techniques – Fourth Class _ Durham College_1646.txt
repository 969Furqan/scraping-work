Power Engineering Techniques – Fourth Class Program Overview
Fourth class power engineers operate and maintain industrial boilers, refrigeration systems, and auxiliary equipment used for heating, cooling and power applications in large facilities such as hospitals and schools, as well as industrial plants and power stations.
Accredited by the Technical Standards & Safety Authority (TSSA), the Power Engineering Techniques – Fourth Class program
at Durham College
is introduces students to the theoretical and practical aspects of power generation and plant operation.
In this power engineering program, you learn the relevant theory in the classroom, and
then apply that theory
in Durham College’s state-of-the-art registered Power Plant.
The opportunity to apply theory helps solidify what you learn in the classroom—this advantage makes Durham College’s power engineering program among the finest in the country.
We also
combine v
irtual reality technology with electrical labs,
allowing
students
to
gain practical experience and develop critical skills in a dynamic and engaging way.
With the support of our expert faculty, students emerge from the 4
th
Class Power Engineering program take the next step toward TSSA certification.
Students who successfully complete
the
program may be eligible for a nine-month reduction of qualifying experience time (steam time). After successfully completing TSSA testing and acquiring three months of industry experience, graduates
can
qualify for their Fourth-Class Operating Engineer Certificate of Qualification.
