Program Details
Chemical engineering technology is about creating value through chemical conversions, from lab-scale processes to optimizing full plant operations. Applications include nuclear industry, manufacturing of purified metals, water treatment operations, material coatings and sustainable fuel sources. Chemical engineering technologists play a role in each of these areas, and this program prepares career-ready graduates for these fields.
This program will give you hands-on experience and a solid background in analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, nuclear physics and instrumental analysis including chromatography and spectroscopy, and process control and sustainability. Working alone and in teams, first-hand experience is emphasized through our fully equipped Analytical Instrumentation laboratory as well as process development and simulation. The core of the program will give you training and experience in the handling, analyzing, monitoring, processing and properties of a wide variety of chemicals.
Safety and environmental compliance are both emphasized in the program. An 80-hour field placement provides valuable contacts and experience.
Program Learning Outcomes
Perform all work in compliance with relevant statutes, regulations, standards, practices and guidelines.
Implement, co-ordinate and evaluate quality control and quality assurance procedures to meet organisational standards and requirements.
Troubleshoot industrial or chemical processes and laboratory equipment.
Solve complex problems and perform tasks by applying principles of mathematics, physics, chemistry and chemical engineering.
Perform, co-ordinate, implement and validate laboratory procedures to conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses and tests.
Prepare and purify compounds using standard synthesis and purification procedures.
Maintain and control industrial or chemical processes and assist with their design using chemical engineering principles.
Analyse and interpret data using statistical methods.
Select and use current technologies in chemical engineering tasks and projects.
Prepare, modify, interpret and present technical documents for chemical engineering applications.
