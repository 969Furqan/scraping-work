Program Overview
Quality early childhood education (ECE) is critical in preparing children for future learning. Early childhood educators play an integral role in promoting children’s development from birth to age 12 within the following five domains: cognitive, social, emotional, language and physical.
In the ECE program, students engage in theoretical studies along with practical applications. Learning is complemented by three separate field placements under the supervision of a Registered ECE. These field placement opportunities will be chosen from a variety of early learning settings that serve young children and their families.
Upon completion of the Early Childhood Education program, graduates will apply to the College of Early Childhood Educators, the provincial regulatory body, to become a Registered Early Childhood Educator (RECE) in Ontario.
