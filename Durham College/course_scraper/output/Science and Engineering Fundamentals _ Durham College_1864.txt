Program Details
The fields of science and engineering technology are broad and diverse, from civil engineering and broader construction principles, to environmental and biomedical technology and mechanical and electromechanical technology, science and engineering technologists and technicians work in a wide range of occupations across many sectors within the economy.
This preparatory program explores three streams in science and engineering – Planning and Sustainability, Making Things Work and In the Laboratory. That means graduates will be equipped with the range of skills required to pursue further studies in science and engineering disciplines.
Our expert faculty members will make connections between programs and identify industry and career opportunities, enabling students to become familiar with different designations in these fields and make an informed program choice that supports their future career goals.
Students will spend more than 220 hours in the lab over eight months, gaining hands-on experience and exposure to the foundational principles of science and engineering. This will ensure they develop the fundamental knowledge and skills required for many two-, three- and four-year diploma, advanced diploma and degree programs in the Faculty of SEIT.
PROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES
Use math skills to solve routine problems related to applied science and technology.
Use critical thinking processes and problem-solving techniques to develop systematic approaches in applied science and technology.
Communicate using appropriate language, strategies and techniques to convey messages clearly and concisely in applied science and technology environments.
Use academic strategies to support success and wellness in lifelong learning and career development.
Apply the basic technical skills required to complete a set of procedures in an applied science and technology lab.
Apply digital literacy skills at an introductory level for success in applied science and technology.
Examine the professional requirements and opportunities in various applied science and technology fields to inform academic and professional goals.
Identify and apply discipline-specific practices that contribute to the local and global community through social responsibility, economic commitment and environmental stewardship.
