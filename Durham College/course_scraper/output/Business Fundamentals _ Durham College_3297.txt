Student Testimonials
Testimonial from Parmpreet Kaur (2023 Graduate)
I am incredibly grateful to have been a part of Durham College’s Business Fundamental program.
It has significantly impacted my intellectual and personal development in numerous ways.
T
he dedicated faculty and staff provided consistent support, creating an environment where I could thrive both inside and outside the classroom.
The curriculum was carefully designed to provide a thorough understanding of subjects while also promoting critical-thinking and innovation.
Beyond academics, the program offered a vibrant environment in which I formed lifetime friendships and professional connections.
Thanks to Durham college’s seminars and Job fairs, I
was able to get a job right after I graduated from college. I am confident that the knowledge and experiences I received here will continue to benefit my life and career.
Testimonial from Meghan Scanlon (2022 Graduate)
When I first started in the Business Fundamentals program at Durham College, I was unsure which field of study to pursue. Through the various classes offered, I was able to get a better understanding thanks to hands-on classes and technical assignments as well as the professors who taught me about Marketing, which led me to further my studies in this field. In pursuing Marketing as my field of study, I have been able to attend events and competitions that have helped me prepare for my future, connect with CEOs, business representatives, and even travel to further gain stronger connections across Canada and even into the U.S.. Durham College is leading the way with the Business Fundamentals program, and I am so happy I was able to start my future here.
