Program Details
Pharmaceutical Science involves all aspects of the design, development, manufacturing, administration, and use of finished drug products. In this program, you will develop an understanding of the Canadian pharmaceutical, cannabis and natural health product landscape including manufacturers, distributors and regulatory bodies and the impact of international markets and regulators on Canadian operations.
A strong focus is placed upon understanding Good Lab, Documentation, and Manufacturing Practices and Quality Control and Quality Assurance practices. The expanding fields and opportunities of biotherapeutics, cannabis and natural health products will also be explored.
Students will gain hands-on experience working in our labs following in-house and pharmacopeia methods to assess the safety, identity, strength, purity and quality of raw materials and finished products to prepare you to work in wet chemistry, analytical instrumentation and microbiology labs. Experiments are modelled after real-world applications to mimic industry protocols.
In the final semester, students will apply your knowledge and skills through a 280-hour placement at a pharmaceutical or related organization to launch your career in this exciting industry.
Program Learning Outcomes
Evaluate methodologies and perform analysis and purification procedures for chemical compounds
and samples in a scientifically relevant and compliant manner.
