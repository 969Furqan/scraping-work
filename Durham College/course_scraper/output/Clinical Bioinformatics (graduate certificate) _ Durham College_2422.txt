Program Details
The Canadian bio-health economy is rapidly
growing
and it is expected that an
additional
36,000 workers will be needed to meet the
labour
market demand in the next five years. Established to meet the needs of the developing medical informatics, computational biology and medical technology fields, Durham College’s (DC) Clinical Bioinformatics Ontario college graduate certificate program is specifically designed to prepare students with the knowledge, skills and
expertise
required
to further their careers thr
ough focused use of data and data analytics for disease pathology research.
Graduates from this program are specialized in the area of big biological data management and well-prepared for further career advancement.
By using industry-based software for biological data analysis, including identification and evaluation of disease and disorder-associated biomarkers and
determine
therapeutic efficacy of drugs, students are equipped with the specialized skills they need to succeed post-graduation. Graduates feel confident in their ability to develop methodologies and hypotheses,
utilize
current bioinformatics software to manage large genetic databases and research the pathology of diseases to develop treatment hypotheses.
Through a variety of specially designed courses and a mandatory 14-week, 210-hour field placement or simulated project-based field experience, students gain the valuable hands-on experience they need to succeed in the health sciences industry. DC is dedicated to
assisting
students in securing their field placements and supports them throughout the process.
PROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES
As a graduate of the Clinical Bioinformatics graduate certificate program, you will be able to:
Identify relevant evidence-based research, trends, technologies, and standards within the field of bioinformatics to maintain currency in the industry;
Apply bioinformatics and computational methods to the design, execution and interpretation of scientific research;
Employ programming language and scripting versatility to automate processes at the application level;
Examine bioinformatics data to discover patterns, draw conclusions and generate predictions for subsequent experiments;
Comply with legal obligations, as well as professional and ethical standards, to ensure privacy, security and confidentiality in the access, retention, storage and disposal of personal genetic data and related health information;
Use statistics in the analysis, collation and interpretation of data to draw conclusions and support informed decision-making;
Perform laboratory duties in compliance with pertinent health and safety legislation and regulations.
Complete complex genomic and proteomics applications using advanced principles of cell and molecular biology, pharmacology and toxicology, pathophysiology, endocrinology, and biochemistry;
Collaborate and communicate with inter-professional healthcare teams to optimize the health and well-being of individuals; and
Develop and implement effective strategies for ongoing personal and professional development that support currency, competence and ethics in clinical bioinformatics.

Field Placement
Students gain work-integrated learning experience in a supervised setting through a variety of specialized courses and a mandatory 14-week, 210-hour field placement or simulated project-based field experience
in semester two.
This is an integral part of this graduate certificate program that equips graduates with the knowledge and skills required to successfully apply your expertise in the bioinformatics field.
PRE-PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS
Please note: There are costs associated with Electronic Requirements Verification (ERV), immunizations, lab tests and certifications.  Be sure to keep all of your receipts for income tax purposes. These costs include:
Service fees for
Verified
, our documentation collection and ERV verification partner.
Costs to complete mandatory immunizations, lab tests, and certifications.
It is required that students have completed the ERV with Verified to be eligible for the field placement component of this program. You must (at your expense) provide:
A clear and current Criminal Reference Check (CRC) with Vulnerable Sector Screening (VSS). If you cannot provide a clear CRC with VSS, you may not be accepted for placement by a field placement agency. CRCs with VSS must be obtained from your local police station. You may be required to obtain additional CRCs with VSS to meet field placement agency requirements.
Entry immunization form completed by a health-care provider; requirement may be site-specific.
