Program Overview
Canada has welcomed millions of newcomers in the past decade which has greatly increased demand for legal services and case management related to the immigration process.
The Immigration Case Management graduate certificate program will help students acquire specialized knowledge in the highly complex area of immigration, refugee and citizenship law as well as interpersonal and legal administrative support skills setting you up to excel in an in-demand field.
Graduating from one of only two immigration case management programs at a public college in Canada, students will be well-positioned to support legal practitioners, specifically immigrations lawyers and licensed immigration and citizenship consultants, in their practices or community service providers at non-government and community organizations supporting newcomers.
