Program Details
Developed in response to the growing need for paralegals in Ontario, this three-year degree program is the first of its kind in the province and prepares students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to work in a variety of legal fields and apply to the Law Society of Ontario to become a licensed paralegal. It also offers graduates the flexibility to apply to law school, or transfer into an honours program that enables them to apply to graduate studies.
In Canada, in addition to lawyers, there are professions that provide legal services under varying degrees of lawyer supervision, including law clerks, legal assistants and paralegals. In Ontario, Paralegal is established as a licensed and regulated profession that can work independently within a prescribed scope of practice.  Durham College’s (DC) Paralegal - Bachelor program is grounded in the entry-level competencies of a licensed paralegal in Ontario and the complex legal thinking required to practice in court and tribunal proceedings.
Students in the program explore and examine constitutional law and the Charter, criminal and summary convictions, contracts and tort law, the law of Tribunals, the procedure and practice for small claims court, the theory and strategies of negotiations and mediation, insurance law and employment law.
Beyond the discipline of law, the program includes six courses to enhance students’ social and political awareness, critical thinking skills and legal context required to make meaningful contributions in a range of organizations as well as the cultural competency lens to provide legal services to diverse populations including immigrants, refugees, Indigenous peoples, women and people who identify as LGBTQ+.
Through a comprehensive mix of theoretical, research and applied courses, students will apply their knowledge in a mandatory 14-week, 420-hour experiential field placement. Students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills required to successfully apply their expertise and professional practice in a legal setting with the ability to translate theoretical learning to the actual field. DC’s Faculty of Social and Community Services is dedicated to assisting students securing their field placement and supports them throughout the process.
Graduates of DC’s Paralegal
diploma program
can also further their education by entering in year three of the Bachelor of Paralegal program, if desired.
