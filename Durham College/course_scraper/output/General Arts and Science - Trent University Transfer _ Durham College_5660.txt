Program Details
The General Arts and Science Trent Transfer pathway is specifically designed for individuals interested in pursuing studies in Trent University’s Bachelor of Arts (Honours) or Bachelor of Science (Honours).
This two-semester program provides opportunities to refine essential academic skills and develop the foundational knowledge needed to ensure success in subsequent post-secondary studies. Additionally, it is intended for individuals who wish to strengthen their critical thinking and communication skills, increase their knowledge of the social sciences, and acquaint themselves with rigors and opportunities of post-secondary life.
Students will be required to complete six courses per semester (12 courses in total). Topics and subject areas include academic preparation, critical thinking, computer skills, communications, law, political science, psychology, and sociology, among others.
Upon successful completion of the General Arts and Science Trent Transfer stream, students with a minimum 70% average overall and a minimum of 65% in each of the required courses will be eligible to apply to a Bachelor of Arts program at Trent University on an advanced standing basis into Year 2.
The student advisor offers individual academic planning assistance; students are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor before selecting courses. Some General Arts and Science courses may also be transferable to other post-secondary programs.
PLEASE NOTE:
It is each student’s responsibility to ensure that the courses they register in are appropriate for the stated admission requirements for future program choices.
Successful completion of the GASA certificate does not guarantee admission into Trent or other post-secondary programs.
Each educational institution determines its own admission requirements. If you plan to attend any university other than Trent or plan to attend another college, please ensure that courses taken meet that institution’s admission requirements.
