Project Lord Ridgeback
Project Lord Ridgeback (PLRB) is multi-disciplinary experiential learning exercise that simulates a local disaster. Interacting with actors who play victims, casualties, emotionally distressed persons and the elderly in a staged, choreographed event, students from a wide range of programs learn by acting and responding as they would in real emergencies. Subject matter experts design injects into disaster-related scenarios which simulate authentic workplace demands.
Following the mock disaster, students participate in follow up exercises to apply learning in mock court testimony, critical incident stress debrief, crime-scene lab work, and form completion specific to their program areas.
Student participants are from a wide range of DC programs including: Practical Nursing, Primary Care Paramedic, Police Foundations, Protection Security & Investigation, Paralegal, 911 Call Centre Communications, Advanced Law Enforcement and Investigations, Journalism Mass Media Program, Social Service Worker, Activation Co-ordination – Gerontology, Court Support Services.
Living Lab
The Living Lab at Durham College mimics a typical residential unit, allowing students to work through real-life scenarios that depict several challenges they will face in their future careers. Complete with obstacles to problem solve and work around, such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, and laundry room, students learn to not only care for the patient, but to be mindful of their environment as well.
In an emergency, a person’s life can depend on the decision making and the abilities of the paramedic to take swift action;
the Living Lab ensures that the students are well prepared and confident to meet the demand of this challenging career head on. Students plan and try out what they learn in the lab and are able to apply the new knowledge to future situations. By going beyond the theory learned in class and learning by doing, students get first-hand experience of practicing what has been taught to retain the life-saving skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.
