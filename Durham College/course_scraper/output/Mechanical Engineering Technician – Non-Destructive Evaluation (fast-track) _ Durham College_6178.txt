Program Overview
The Mechanical Engineering Technician – Non-Destructive Evaluation (fast-track) program is designed specifically for applicants with existing academic credentials. Students with a degree in a related field can expand their knowledge of the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) industry and complete an advanced diploma in just two semesters.
Students will learn about materials and specific testing methods in order to examine structures and components such as cars, trains, airplanes, spacecraft, towers, bridges, ships, power plants and amusement park rides to name a few to identify and analyze possible defects.
In addition to gaining hands-on experience during the program, graduates may be eligible to receive the training certificates required for NDT personnel qualification.

Program Details
This fast-track program is for eligible domestic or internationally educated professionals with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree.
The two semesters will provide you with the training and hands-on experience necessary to begin a career in non-destructive evaluation/testing (NDE/NDT) and receive the training certificates required for NDT personnel qualification. In combination with your degree these skills will allow you to assess the data collected from the inspections/tests and provide reports.
NDT inspectors engage in the examination and testing of cars, trains, airplanes, space craft towers, bridges, ships, power plants, amusement park rides etc. You will learn how to examine these objects without causing damage or impairment to their future use, hence the term non-destructive. You will also learn how testing this way is used to detect possible internal or external defects and examine the object's properties.
At the end of the program, you will be eligible to take method-specific certification exams regulated by the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB) standard 48.9712 if you have 70 per cent or higher in the related NDT courses.  Certificates of training are provided at the end of the program for each successful method course completed.
