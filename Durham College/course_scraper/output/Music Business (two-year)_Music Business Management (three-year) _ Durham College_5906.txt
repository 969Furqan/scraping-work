Experiential Learning
MUSIC BUSINESS PRACTICUM
The Music Business Practicum (MBP) course is unique; here, your textbook is life itself and you are the author. You will have a job and it will be your homework.
This course, which you take for four semesters, provides you with hands-on, practical, networking and business experience similar to what you will encounter in the music industry. MBP offers you the chance to learn by doing. In the process you will learn plenty of useful and important things about the industry and yourself.
In MBP first and second-year students work together and with the community to operate our own music industry. There are several enterprises to which you can apply in order to become a valued team member and get a great learning experience. These include record labels, artist management companies, the campus radio station, a recording studio, a music magazine, a merchandising company, an event production company, a publicity and promotion company, photography and video production, and more.
In order to pass each MBP course, you are required to:
accumulate a minimum of 30 hours of approved, authentic work experience, AND
successfully complete the required written assignments.
You will continually gain real-world experience for your resumé, which will greatly improve your job prospects. Employers want people with experience and MBP gives you a great opportunity to get exactly that, in and outside of the classroom.
field placement
One of the key strengths of the Music Business Management program is the field placement component, which offers students the opportunity to apply their new academic knowledge in a supervised workplace setting. For both semesters of the third year, students work for an industry organization two days a week for a total of 210 hours per semester. This is an excellent opportunity for students to apply what they have learned in the program, gain the basic skills necessary to compete for entry-level positions in a highly specialized field, and to make all-important industry contacts.
