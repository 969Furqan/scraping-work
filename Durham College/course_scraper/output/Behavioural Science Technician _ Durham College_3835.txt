Program Details
This interdisciplinary program prepares students to build a career that combines an interest in human behaviour with a desire to help others improve their quality of life. Students will develop professional competencies that link science, clinical, communication and ethical aspects of behavioural science. With a focus on Applied Behaviour Analysis educational, community and clinical settings, students gain the knowledge and skills to support clients from various age groups and learn how to assist with behavioural assessments and contribute to the design and application of behaviour change plans for clients with developmental disabilities, autism, acquired brain injuries, dementia and other conditions associated with aging.
Program Learning Outcomes
Implement effective behaviour analytic intervention strategies based on the science of Applied
Behaviour Analysis (ABA) in order to increase desired behaviours, teach new skills, and decrease
contextually problematic behaviours.
Explain behavioural concepts and skills to families and interdisciplinary team members to
facilitate goal setting.
Write clear and professional documentation, using behavioural terms and concepts, for a variety of
audiences.
Apply systems thinking to behavioural processes to change socially significant behaviour and
support quality of life and long-term planning.
Adhere to federal, provincial, professional policies, regulations and ethical codes associated with
practicing Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).
Apply input gained from collaboration with stakeholders (including individuals, family members,
and community members) and professionals in the field of service into effective client service
intervention.
Develop a reflective practice, using professional development and self-care strategies to enhance
professional competence.
Collaborate in the development of client-centered behavioural intervention plans that account for
individuals’ rights, needs, goals, and their social and community context.
Assist in the assessment, design and implementation of behaviour change plans for individuals,
families and/or groups, based on principles of learning and behaviour therapy, current research
and evidence-based practice.
