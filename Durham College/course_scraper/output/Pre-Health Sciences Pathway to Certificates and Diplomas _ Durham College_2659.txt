Program Details
The Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Certificates and Diplomas (PHSC) program is designed for individuals interested in pursuing a health sciences career.  This two-semester program provides the foundation necessary for success in a college health sciences program such
as
,
Practical Nursing, Dental Assistant, Dental Hygiene, Occupational Therapist Assistant
,
Physiotherapist Assistant
, and Paramedics
.
It is also designed for individuals who would like to strengthen their communication, mathematics, biology, chemi
stry and critical thinking or physics skills as well as familiarize themselves with college life and college workload.
In addition, the program provides students with the opportunity to learn about potential careers in the health sciences while earning postsecondary credits that could be transferred to other health sciences or science-related programs.
PLEASE NOTE:
Successful completion of the PHSC certificate does not guarantee admission into another post-secondary program.
Students who intend to use the PHSC program to satisfy the admission requirements for another program should be aware of the required application and final mark submission deadlines.
The January intake of the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Diplomas program may not line up with application deadlines for a fall start. Students must be sure to check the website for application deadlines at the institution to which they intend to apply.
Students interested in further study at the university level should enrol in the
Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees

Each educational institution determines its own admission requirements. If a student plans to attend any college other than Durham College, or a university, they must ensure that the courses they take meet the admission requirements of that institution.
Individual academic planning assistance is offered by the student advisor and students are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor before selecting their courses. Some Pre-Health Sciences Pathway courses are also transferable to other post-secondary programs.
