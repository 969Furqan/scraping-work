The six-semester
graphic design

at Durham College
prepares graduates for work as entry-level designers
in
a wide variety of professional roles and contexts.
Through a meticulously planned series of graphic design courses, s

the
skills required to solve specific visual problems through practical work,
using cutting-edge hardware and software. Their graphic design courses
cover a broad spectrum of visual communication in corporate, editorial, advertising and package design.
The program of studies in
the
first year
lays the foundation for more advanced classes in graphic design. It
includes
the study of:
Design concepts
Motion graphics and web design

Fundamentals of design
Typography

second and third year

apply these principles to a variety of design problems.
For example, they might work on developing a cohesive brand identity for a fictional company, which could involve creating a logo, selecting appropriate typography, and designing marketing materials that represent the brand and communicate its message effectively to the target consumer group. Another design problem commonly used in graphic design
courses
involves creating a layout for a magazine. In this work, students enrolled in the graphic design program have to figure out how to balance text and images while maintaining readability and visual appeal. Graphic design program students might also work on designing digital interfaces, solving issues related to user experience and functionality. These hands-on projects help students build the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for real-world design scenarios.

include
