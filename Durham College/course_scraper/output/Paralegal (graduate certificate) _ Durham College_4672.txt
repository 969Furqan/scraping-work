Program Overview
Accredited by the Law Society of Ontario (LSO), this program qualifies graduates to apply to write the LSO’s licensing examination to become a professional, licensed paralegal.

This three-semester program is designed for students with prior post-secondary education or related industry experience. In-class learning is complemented by a 240-hour field placement with a licensed paralegal or lawyer, in a government, court or law firm setting to gain practical, hands-on experience.

Program Details
Whether you provide paralegal services in your own professional capacity, as a member of a law or paralegal firm, or as an employee of a government agency, your passion and integrity combined with extensive skills and knowledge, will make you the ideal legal representative for those challenged by the law.
This program is accredited by the Law Society of Ontario (LSO), the regulatory body governing professional paralegals in the province, and meets its rigorous competencies for paralegals. It will prepare you for the LSO’s paralegal licensing examination, which graduates are eligible to write, and is designed to provide the specialized knowledge and skills required to independently provide legal services as a professional, licensed paralegal or work as a paralegal under the supervision of a lawyer.
The graduate certificate program is also designed specifically for individuals who have a degree or diploma consisting of law-related courses or three to five years of legal-related experience. Upon licensing by the LSO, you can provide legal services within authorized areas of practice.
Graduates who successfully complete the LSO’s Licensing Examination are recognized as Professional Licensed Paralegals and are afforded the privilege of providing legal services in prescribed areas of law before many courts and tribunals in Ontario, such as Small Claims Court, Provincial Offences Court, Criminal Summary Conviction matters, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, and the Landlord and Tenant Board, to name a few.  Graduates may also find employment in law firms, working under the supervision of a licensed lawyer or paralegal, immigration and refugee law, as well as in several organizations approved by the LSO in By-Law #4.
Furthermore, Graduates may decide to continue their education and achieve further academic credentials.  There are many favourable “bridging” opportunities to universities at which graduates can achieve a university degree in a condensed period.
