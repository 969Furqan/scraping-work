Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Fire Prevention and Technology Advanced Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their second academic semester. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive.  Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete a four-month, paid work term between the fourth and fifth semesters of their program.
Supports are available through Experiential Learning to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, Experiential Learning is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.
