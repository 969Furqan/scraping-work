Program Details
This program will provide you with the education, training and practical experience necessary to begin a career in non-destructive evaluation/testing.  You will embark on an education covering the main methods of testing utilizing methods and technological applications of ultrasound, radiation, magnetism and vision, to name a few.
You will learn how to examine engineered materials and components including such things cars, trains, aircraft, spacecraft, towers, bridges, ships, power plants and amusement park rides without causing damage or impairment to their future use, hence the term non-destructive. You will also learn how testing in a non-destructive fashion is used to detect possible internal or external defects to ensure the safety of lives, assets and the environment and examine the properties of an object.
This program is regulated by the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB) 48.9712 standard administered by Natural Resources Canada NDTCB and provides eligibility to write certification exams upon graduation. A minimum 70 per cent grade is required in Introduction to Non-Destructive Testing, Mathematics for Technology II and all Non-destructive testing method courses in order to be eligible for training certificates.
At
the end of the program, you will be eligible to take method-specific certification exams regulated by the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB) standard 48.9712 if you have 70 per cent or higher in the related NDT courses.  Certificates of training are provided at the end of the program for each successful method course completed.
As a graduate, you will also be eligible for membership in the Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists (OACETT).
Please note: Prospective students should consider their comfort in confined spaces or at heights when determining suitability for this field. Prior to certification exams, tests of visual acuity are required. Some organizations also require a police check prior to employment.
ACCREDITATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS
As a graduate, you will also be eligible for OACETT membership.
Students can register for Canadian Institute of non-destructive evaluation membership.  This program is an RTO (recognized training organization) for NDT in Canada and the training is provided to an internationally recognized ISO standard.
