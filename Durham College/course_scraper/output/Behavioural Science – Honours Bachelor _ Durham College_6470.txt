Program Details
The Honours Bachelor of Behavioural Science (HBBS) is designed to provide students with professional competencies that link science, clinical, communication and ethical aspects of behavioural science. There is a strong focus on Applied Behaviour Analysis, Cognitive Behavioural therapy, acceptance and mindfulness-based therapies, to ensure that graduates possess broad knowledge, skills and judgement, leading to a variety of professional employment opportunities or future studies, including at the master’s degree level.
