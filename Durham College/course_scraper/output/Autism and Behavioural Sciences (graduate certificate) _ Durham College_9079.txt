Program Overview
As the rate of Ontarians living with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) continues to rise, so is the need for skilled professionals who are prepared to use evidence-based interventions to support individuals, as well as their families and caregivers. Students in the Autism and Behavioural Sciences graduate certificate program will develop expertise in the collaborative design, implementation and evaluation of effective behavioural intervention plans, according to the principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis. They will also gain valuable work experience through two supervised field placements.
