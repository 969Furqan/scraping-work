FAQ
What is the transfer to Ontario Tech University Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) embedded program?
This joint Durham College and Ontario Tech University diploma-to-degree program will enable you to earn a diploma and degree in only four years. As a student participating in this program, you will be registered at Durham College and at Ontario Tech. There are 5 Ontario Tech courses embedded in the Durham College curriculum.
Is there a mandatory Ontario Tech application?
Yes, there is a mandatory Ontario Tech application. If you don’t submit it by the semester 1 deadline, you’ll be transferred into the regular 2-year diploma program without Ontario Tech courses. The internal Ontario Tech application has no associated cost.
How do I submit an application to Ontario Tech?
You’ll receive an invitation to an information session in semester 1 via your DC Mail. This session will provide you with the Ontario Tech application and application deadline. The application will be sent to your DC Mail.
What is the grade requirement for program eligibility?
To be eligible, you must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5 (B+ or 75-79%) within the Durham College program and a minimum “C” (60-66%) in all five embedded courses taken at Ontario Tech. Note that each institution has different grading systems.
What if I don’t meet the grade requirements?
Your final grades are reviewed each semester. If your Durham College cumulative GPA falls below 3.5, you’ll be notified and removed from the program. You may have the opportunity to continue into the regular 2- or 3-year diploma program at Durham College without Ontario Tech courses or explore alternate pathway options with Ontario Tech.
Are there additional fees for the five Ontario Tech courses?
Yes, students must pay additional fees for each Ontario Tech course taken during each semester. Ontario Tech fees are charged at the beginning of each semester. If you receive OSAP, inform them about the additional fees for the university courses.
How do I register for the five Ontario Tech courses?
You will select your Durham College timetable when the registration window opens up. Your Ontario Tech courses will appear as placeholders on your Durham College schedule to avoid scheduling conflicts between the two institutions. Ontario Tech will manually register you in their courses for each semester once eligibility is confirmed.
Will I receive a diploma from Durham College?
Upon successfully completing all required Durham College and the five Ontario Tech courses in your program of study, you’ll receive a 2-year diploma from Durham College.
Can I transfer out of the program after starting Ontario Tech courses while still completing my diploma?
Yes, you can transfer, but the timing matters. Depending on when you transfer, you might miss Durham College courses needed to graduate from the 2- or 3-year regular diploma (without Ontario Tech courses). Contact your Durham College
Student Advisor
for assistance.
Do I have to continue to third year at Ontario Tech?
No, it’s not mandatory. However, you won’t receive a Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) degree from Ontario Tech. Upon successful completion of both Durham College and the five Ontario Tech courses, you’ll receive your 2-year Durham College diploma.
Can I repeat an Ontario Tech course if I’m not successful in my first attempt?
Yes, but only once. You’ll need to pay full fees to Ontario Tech for the retake. Contact your
Student Advisor
at Durham College to complete the appropriate registration forms; self-registration isn’t allowed for a retake of a course.
Can I major at Ontario Tech starting in year 3?
Ontario Tech offers majors for some programs. In semester 4 of your Durham College program, you can apply for the corresponding program you are graduating from at Durham College. ACTU is the only program that requires additional admission requirements, which will be provided to you during the information session in semester 1 of the Durham College program.
Can I apply for credit transfer for any of the Ontario Tech embedded courses or Durham College courses?
If you’ve previously studied at Durham College or another recognized post-secondary institution, you may be eligible for credit transfer for Durham College courses. However, Ontario Tech doesn’t accept credit transfers for the five embedded courses. Students must complete all five embedded courses with Ontario Tech.
