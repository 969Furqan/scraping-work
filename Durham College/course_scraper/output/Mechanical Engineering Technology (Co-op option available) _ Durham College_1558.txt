Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Mechanical Engineering Technology Advanced Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first academic semester. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive. Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete two four-month, paid work terms totaling 840 hours. Work terms are scheduled between semesters two and three and four and five of the program.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions.
