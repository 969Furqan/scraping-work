Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Business Administration – Supply Chain and Operations Management Advanced Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first year of study. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive. Students enrolled in the co-op option  who qualify for co-op will be eligible to complete a four-month, paid work term between the second and third years of their program. Students interested in co-op may also apply to transfer to the co-op internship option of their program which would extend the work integrated learning opportunity to 4 consecutive work terms.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning  office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.
