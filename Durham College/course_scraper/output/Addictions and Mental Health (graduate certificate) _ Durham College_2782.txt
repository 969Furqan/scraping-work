Program Details
Designed for students with previous, relevant education, this highly specialized program was developed and remains current, in consultation with recognized experts in addiction and mental health, including Lakeridge Health Corporation.
This program meets the standards of the Canadian Addiction Counsellors Certification Federation (CACCF) and will be accepted as recognized formal addiction education should a graduate apply for certification with the CACCF.
Program highlights include the opportunity to:
Expand the skills required to practice in addiction and mental health settings.
Gain experience with a broad spectrum of clinical settings where addiction/mental health related issues arise.
Develop an understanding of the particular needs of diverse populations.
Receive training in contemporary, evidence-based approaches to counselling and case management.

Please note: Some courses may be delivered online or in blended formats using the college's learning management system.
Enrolment considerations
It is important for individuals interested in this program to consider that the topics covered (e.g. trauma, abuse, suicidality, overdose), as well as images and videos shown in some courses can potentially be emotionally dysregulating to some. There are instances when professors and guest speakers will show drug paraphernalia. These topics and images are an unavoidable aspect of working in this field, therefore it is important that before entering the program, prospective students strongly consider if they are able to experience these aspects of the program without becoming excessively emotionally dysregulated.
