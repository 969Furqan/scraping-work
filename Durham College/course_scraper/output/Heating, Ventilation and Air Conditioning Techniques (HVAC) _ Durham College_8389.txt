Program Details
The core curriculum of the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Techniques (HVAC) program is standardized and accredited by the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA), the industry’s regulatory body. As a student in this
program,
you will focus on:
Fundamentals of heating, ventilation and air conditioning
Hot water systems and refrigeration principles
Industry standardized design practices for residential heating
Installation of gas piping for heating or hot water appliances
You will:
Be exposed to the design and development of systems including the basic need to assist with working on a wide range of furnaces, cooling systems and appliances
Develop skills in soldering, wiring and electric circuitry for HVAC and gas installation systems
As a graduate, you will be eligible to challenge TSSA for Gas Technician 3 and Oil Burner Technician 3 certification as the theoretical and practical skills
required
to obtain both entry-level certifications will be covered.
Durham College arranges for the Gas Technician 3 and Oil Burner 3 challenge exams to be
facilitated
at our Whitby campus for a cost of approximately $235 each.
Exams may not be rescheduled and are non-refundable.
If
you miss an exam, you will
be responsible for
arranging your own testing schedule with TSSA.
Please note:
Although the passing standard for Durham College is 70 per cent, the passing grade on the examination and practical skills demonstration for TSSA is 75 per cent. Failure to successfully complete the exam as noted above will result in a failing TSSA grade.
The TSSA has minimum attendance policy to be eligible to write their exams.
Payment for the above exams must be made at CTS, Whitby campus, by the deadline date provided to you in class. Receipts must be presented at time of examination and no exceptions will be allowed.
You should check with TSSA for details regarding certification.
