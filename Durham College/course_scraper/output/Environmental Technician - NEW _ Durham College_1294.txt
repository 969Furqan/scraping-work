Program Details
The need to mitigate adverse environmental impacts caused by human activity is an urgent and ongoing issue.
Environmental technicians play a key role in assisting environmental protection and sustainability efforts. They provide technical support and services – including identifying, evaluating, monitoring and controlling potential risks to the environment and public health – to environmental scientists, engineers, lawyers and other professionals.
The Environmental Technician Diploma program prepares students with the knowledge and skills for careers in the prevention, control and elimination of environmental hazards and remediation of contaminated sites.
In this program, students will explore scientific and engineering theory, principles and practices as well as examine chemistry, biology, sustainability, social responsibility, environmental legislation and project management.
Strong emphasis is placed on chemistry and the practical application of skills and students will collect, process, and test soil, air, and water samples, both in the field and laboratory, utilizing spectrometry, chromatography and various portable instruments for environmental analysis.
Graduates will be able to use scientific concepts and models to collect representative environmental samples and perform routine tests with the appropriate equipment and materials as well as provide technical support for the investigation, assessment, monitoring and controlling pollution levels in air, water and soil. They work within the parameters of relevant and current environmental protection legislation, codes, policies and procedures and can provide support in the use of environmental management systems and sustainability programs.
Graduates will be prepared to be entry-level environmental technicians and have the knowledge and skills for employment and career opportunities in environmental investigation and enforcement for government agencies; pollution abatement and clean-up for industries; operation of water and wastewater treatment facilities for municipalities; and technical support personnel for engineering and environmental consulting firms. The employment opportunities are varied and can include areas of business, industry and government and public organizations.
ACCREDITATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS
Graduates can register to become a certified technician through the Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists (OACETT), a self-governing body that is widely recognized by employers and professionals across Canada.
OACETT offers voluntary designations for Certified Technicians (CTech). Graduates of this program will have the required credential to register as a C.Tech with OACETT.
DC students in the EVTN program are also eligible to apply for a OACETT student membership.
The OACETT belongs to one of nine provinces that is nationally affiliated with Technology Professionals Canada (TPC) and Technology Accreditation Canada (TAC). It follows TAC standards for technician and technologist certification and accreditation of post-secondary technician and technologist programs.
Graduates can register to become a certified Environmental Professional in Training (EPt) through EcoCanada,
a nationally recognized professional environmental designation.
EPt Designation is a multi-disciplinary environmental professional certification for specialists across all industries in Canada who are dedicated to the advancement of sustainable practice and responsible economic growth.
PROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES
Collect representative environmental samples and perform routine tests, using current and relevant tools.
Use scientific concepts and models when contributing to the prevention, control and elimination of environmental hazards and remediation of contaminated sites.
Assist with analysis of water/soil/air samples and with the resolution of environmental problems through the application of scientific and engineering principles.
