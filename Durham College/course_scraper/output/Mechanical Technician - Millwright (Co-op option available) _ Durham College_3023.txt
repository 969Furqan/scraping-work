Program Overview
A machine can do many amazing things, but it
can’t
take care of itself. This program allows students to develop skills in the theory and practice of machine fabrication and maintenance procedures including the installation, service,
repair
and overhaul of industrial machinery. Graduates are eligible for exemption from all the in-school requirements for IMM 433A apprenticeship training and
have the opportunity to meet the
Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development
Working at Heights training requirement.

Co-operative Education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Similar to an academic course, work terms are a mandatory component to this form of experiential learning.

Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Mechanical Techniques – Millwright Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first academic semester. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive.  Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete a four-month, paid work term between the second and third semesters of their program.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.
