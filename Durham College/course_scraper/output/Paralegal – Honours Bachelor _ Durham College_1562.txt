Program Details
Developed in response to the growing need for legal representation and access to the justice system, this degree program prepares students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to work in a variety of legal fields.
The Honours Bachelor of Paralegal (HBPL) program is grounded in the entry-level competencies of a licensed paralegal in Ontario and the complex legal thinking required to practice in court and tribunal proceedings. In Canada, legal services are not exclusively provided by lawyers, there are professions that provide legal services under varying degrees of lawyer supervision, including law clerks, legal assistants and paralegals. In Ontario, Paralegal is established as a licensed and regulated profession that can work independently within a prescribed scope of practice.
Students in the HBPL program explore and examine constitutional law and the Charter, criminal and summary convictions, contracts and tort law, the law of Tribunals, the procedure and practice for small claims court, the theory and strategies of negotiations and mediation, insurance law and employment law.
Courses in this program will provide students with the legal context they require as well as the cultural competency lens to provide legal services to diverse populations including immigrants, refugees, Indigenous peoples, women and people who identify as 2SLGBTQIA+. To best serve their future clients, students will gain an in-depth understanding of human rights claims, disability applications, Immigration and Refugee Board hearings, criminal code offences involving those who have experienced inter-generational trauma and applications involving mental health, housing and financial stability issues.
Through a comprehensive mix of theoretical, research and applied courses, students will apply their knowledge in a mandatory 14-week, 420-hour experiential field placement. Students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills required to successfully apply their expertise and professional practice in a legal setting with the ability to translate theoretical learning to the actual field. DC’s Faculty of Social and Community Services is dedicated to assisting students securing their field placement and supports them throughout the process.
Program Learning Outcomes
Evaluate substantive, legal, and procedural issues to determine the legal remedies and facilitate access to justice.
Present legal issues, arguments and solutions using a client-centred service-oriented practice to demonstrate alignment with client needs, objectives, and
goals.
