Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Computer Systems Technology program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first year of study. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive.  Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete a four-month, paid work term between the second and third years of their program.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.
