Living Lab
The Living Lab at Durham College mimics a typical residential unit, allowing students to work through real-life scenarios that depict several challenges they will face in their future careers. Complete with obstacles to problem solve and work around, such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, and laundry room, students learn to not only care for the patient, but to be mindful of their environment as well.
In an emergency, a person’s life can depend on the decision making and the abilities of the paramedic to take swift action;
the Living Lab ensures that the students are well prepared and confident to meet the demand of this challenging career head on. Students plan and try out what they learn in the lab and are able to apply the new knowledge to future situations. By going beyond the theory learned in class and learning by doing, students get first-hand experience of practicing what has been taught to retain the life-saving skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.
