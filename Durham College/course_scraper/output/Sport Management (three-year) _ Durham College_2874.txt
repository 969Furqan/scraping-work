Program Details
As a graduate of Canada’s longest-running college sport management program, you will be prepared to excel in a management role in the business of sport. With a focus on developing skills related to all aspects of the Canadian sports scene, you will be prepared to
enter
any specific sport-related fields by applying the knowledge, experiential learning and concepts gained inside and outside of the classroom.
The program begins with coursework in fundamental business skills and sport industry understanding, progressing to more advanced applications and hands-on learning experiences in the
subsequent
semesters. In addition to formal classroom work, this program offers
numerous
volunteer and networking opportunities, an overnight leadership camp in the third year and a variety of experiential learning options to prepare you for this chosen career. Students conclude their learning with a 500-hour field placement in
their final semester of the program.
Please note
