Program Details
The two-semester General Arts and Science Liberal Arts Ontario Tech University Transfer pathway is designed for individuals interested in pursuing advanced standing into Year 2 of Ontario Tech’s Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Criminology and Justice, Legal Studies, Liberal Studies, Community Development and Policy Studies, Psychology or Communication and Digital Media Studies.
This program will provide opportunities to refine essential academic skills and develop the foundational knowledge needed to ensure success in subsequent post-secondary studies. Additionally, it is intended for individuals who wish to strengthen their critical thinking and communication skills, increase their knowledge of the social sciences and liberal arts, and acquaint themselves with the rigors and opportunities of post-secondary life.
Students will be required to complete six courses per semester (12 courses in total). Topics and subject areas include academic preparation, critical thinking, computer skills, communications, law, political science, psychology, and sociology, among others.
Graduates of this pathway who have completed the requisite courses with a minimum average grade of at least ‘B+’ (77-79 per cent), with no individual course below ‘B-’ (70-72 per cent), may apply for admission with advanced standing into Year 2 of the Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Liberal Arts degree programs. It is important to note that admission based on minimum admission requirements is not guaranteed, and that Ontario Tech will give preference to applicants with the best qualifications.
The student advisor offers individual academic planning assistance; students are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor before selecting their courses. Some General Arts and Science courses are also transferable to other post-secondary programs.
PLEASE NOTE:
It is each student’s responsibility to ensure that the courses they register in are appropriate for the stated admission requirements for future program choices.
Successful completion of the GAST certificate does not guarantee admission into Ontario Tech or other post-secondary programs.
Each educational institution determines its own admission requirements. If you plan to attend any university other than Ontario Tech or plan to continue your studies at another college, please ensure that courses taken meet that institution’s admission requirements.
