Co-operative Education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals. Similar to an academic course, work terms are a mandatory component to this form of experiential learning.

Program Details
This two-year program will provide students with exceptional welding skills sought by employers in the structural, pressure vessel and manufacturing industries. Students will learn from professors with vast welding experience to receive expert knowledge and practical skills that will foster their trade. This program will teach students to create and read blueprints; give them the skills of fitting metals and understanding their characteristics; equip them to work safely in the industry; and give them practical experience in weld shop and inspection methods. During the second year of this program students will manage a capstone project that will test the skills and knowledge they have learned, preparing them for a successful transition to the workplace.
This program provides an opportunity to introduce students to a field where employment opportunities are abundant,
and
train them to meet the growing demands of the welding field. Students will learn traditional forms of welding such as gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux cored arc welding (FCAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), as well as Plasma cutting and Air Arc gouging.
Students will have the opportunity to become
all
position
certified
by the Canadian Welding Bureau
before they graduate.
Graduates will be prepared to work in the manufacturing and construction sectors with the skills and knowledge to find entry level employment opportunities in a number of areas such as welding shops, manufacturers of metal products, piping and structural contractors, automotive and aircraft manufacturers, repair and maintenance services, building and construction industries, railroad and railcar industries and wind turbine manufacturers.
You will learn to:
Perform safe work practices in the welding trade in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) and Regulations for Industrial Establishments.
Prepare and interpret drawings that would typically be used in a manufacturing and/or fabricating environment.
Perform all positions in shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, flux core arc welding, gas tungsten arc welding utilizing mild steel and structural shapes with various consumables as well as open root welding on plate and pipe in all positions using the SMAW process.
Identify the applicable code(s) or standards to be used in conjunction with each specific fabrication activity.
Learn to use fitting skills to control distortion and correction techniques as they apply to expansion and contraction forces.
Note: Shops and classes will be running six days a week. Students may be scheduled to attend shops and classes any day, including Saturday.
Extra certifications may take place outside of regular class time, including evenings and weekends.
Program Learning Outcomes
Perform safe work practices in the welding trade in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) and Regulations for Industrial Establishments.
Prepare and interpret drawings that would typically be used in a manufacturing and/or fabricating environment.
Perform trade related mathematical calculations including volume, area, estimation, geometry, ratio, measurement, weights, loads, and centering of various lifts.
Complete projects using the main cutting, gouging and welding processes of the fabrication industry.
Perform all positions in shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, flux core arc welding, gas tungsten arc welding utilizing mild steel and structural shapes with various consumables.
Perform open root welding on plate and pipe in all positions using the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process.
Describe and identify the common weld defects and faults using destructive and non-destructive examination and testing methods.
Identify and troubleshoot mechanical problems; recommend solutions for repairing and maintaining equipment to industry standard.
Identify the applicable code(s) or standards to be used in conjunction with each specific fabrication activity.

Co-operative education (co-op)
The best way to succeed in your field is to immerse yourself in it! Co-op is an excellent way to build your professional network, explore career paths and apply in-class teachings to real work situations. Co-op is a model of education that integrates academic learning with workplace learning in fields relevant to our students’ academic and personal goals.
Students in the Welding Engineering Technician Diploma program will be invited to apply to the co-op option during their first academic semester. Entrance to the co-op option is limited and the processes for securing a work term are competitive.  Students enrolled in the co-op option are required to complete a four-month, paid work term between the second and third semesters of their program.
Supports are available through the Experiential Learning office to assist students with securing their work terms. In addition, the Experiential Learning office is in contact with co-op students and their employers during the work terms to help with any questions. Upon completing the work term, co-op students return to campus to complete their final two academic semesters of the program before graduating.
