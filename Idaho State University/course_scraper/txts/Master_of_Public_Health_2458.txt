Master of Public Health
The MPH Program at ISU is accredited by the Council for Education in Public Health (CEPH). The 42-credit curriculum has been developed to meet the Public Health Foundational Competencies required for all CEPH-accredited programs. In addition to the traditional public health core knowledge areas of biostatistics, epidemiology, social and behavioral sciences, health services administration, and environmental health sciences, the curriculum also addresses cross-cutting and emerging public health areas.
General Requirements
Applicants' transcripts will be evaluated by the Departmental Graduate Admissions Committee at the time of application to determine if deficiencies exist in the undergraduate coursework. Any deficiency that is identified must be made up prior to beginning the MPH program. Committee members will specify to the student courses that must be taken to rectify any deficiency.
Students pursuing the MPH degree must complete a minimum of 42 credits of coursework, including a 6-credit thesis or capstone/project and 6 credits of elective course work. Examinations for students choosing the capstone/project track are conducted internally through the department, while students choosing to do a thesis will require a Graduate Faculty Representative and will follow ISU Graduate School policies for theses.
All students must maintain a satisfactory record of scholarship. A 3.0 grade point average (GPA) or better is required for any graduate degree or certification at Idaho State University. A grade below B is essentially failing at the graduate level. Students who earn a grade below a B in a core course will be required to retake that course. Students who earn grades below a B in two courses will be dismissed from the program.
