Master of Arts in Sociology
Mission
The mission of the M.A. in Sociology program is to prepare students for careers in sociological practice, research, and/or teaching. We focus on building core skills in social research methodology and theory, as well as tailoring the program to develop secondary skills in areas such as applied data analysis, reporting, and policy development. Our graduates find positions in both the business and non-profit sectors, including in marketing, market research, education, healthcare, criminal justice, and environmental and other non-profits. Other graduates go on to pursue additional graduate education through sociology and social science doctoral degrees, as well as in law and medicine.
Student Learning Outcomes
Students will master literature in at least one substantive area of sociology.
Students will develop an understanding of sociological theory.
Students will become proficient in social research skills, including research design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

In cases of deficiencies, students may be granted waivers, required to enroll in alternative courses, including undergraduate courses, and/or be admitted with performance requirements at the discretion of the M.A. in Sociology Program Director.
Applied Project and Thesis Options
The M.A. in Sociology program offers both an applied project and a thesis option. Depending on career and educational goals, students work with their advisors to determine the option that best fits their goals.
The applied project option helps students prepare for careers in either the business or non-profit sector, including in marketing, market research, education, healthcare, criminal justice, and environmental and other non-profits. Students who pursue this option will complete an applied project that demonstrates mastery of sociological practice skills. The applied project may involve fieldwork, an internship, or other practice components, and will culminate in an applied project document. Full details regarding the guidelines and expectations of students pursuing the applied project option can be found in the M.A. in Sociology Handbook.
The thesis option helps students prepare for additional graduate education, such as doctoral degrees in sociology and social science fields, as well as in law and medicine. Students who pursue this option will complete a thesis based on their own original research. Full details regarding the guidelines and expectations of students pursuing the thesis option can be found in the M.A. in Sociology Handbook.
