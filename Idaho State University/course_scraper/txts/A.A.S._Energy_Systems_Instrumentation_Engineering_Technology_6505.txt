A.A.S. Energy Systems Instrumentation Engineering Technology
(2 Years
)
Program Objectives:
Solve technical problems typical of those encountered in the instrumentation engineering technology discipline by using critical thinking skills, current technology, principles of mathematics, and applied science.
Work and communicate effectively in multidisciplinary teams in both industrial and academic settings.
Understand current professional issues and the need to pursue lifelong learning.
Student Outcomes:
1. Demonstrate safe work practices on industrial equipment.
2. Work and communicate effectively in a diverse team environment.
3. Utilize test equipment to troubleshoot and analyze electrical, electronic, and instrumentation related circuits.
4. Analyze
alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electronic circuits and logic fundamentals.
5. Create schematics to document electrical, electronic, and process control systems.
6. Design and troubleshoot circuits for motor controls and associated devices.
7. Install, troubleshoot, and maintain electrical AC and DC motors, generators, and variable frequency drives.
8. Install, configure, calibrate, and troubleshoot pressure, temperature, level, flow, and analytical instrumentation.
9. Configure, troubleshoot, and optimize Proportional-integral-Derivative (PID) control loops.
10. Use the fundamentals of pump and valve operation to troubleshoot final element issues.
11. Utilize the fundamentals of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to troubleshoot and maintain process control associated with industrial plants.
12. Design, implement, and troubleshoot Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) programs and associated Human Machine Interface (HMI) applications for industrial processes.
13. Utilize the fundamentals of networks and digital communications to troubleshoot and maintain distributed plant automation and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.
Graduates will have a fundamental knowledge of energy systems, thermodynamics, electronics and electrical systems. They will have extensive hands-on experience setting up and troubleshooting single and three-phase motor controls, variable frequency drives, programmable logic controllers, sensors, relays, timers, solenoids, and human machine interface stations. They will be able to install, troubleshoot and calibrate instrumentation that measures and controls temperature, level, flow, pressure and other process variables.
Students must register concurrently for the lab course associated with each theory course.
