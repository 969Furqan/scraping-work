Minor in Film Studies
The Film Studies Minor offers an interdisciplinary curriculum to study and create visual narratives as an art form across cultural, economic, literary, global, and technological contexts. Coursework includes instruction that traces the evolution of formal aesthetics, genres, and industry standards within the medium from early cinema to contemporary digital streaming services. Students in the minor will develop critical thinking skills by analyzing movies as powerful cultural texts and cultivate creative thinking skills and professional opportunities by learning how to develop, pitch, produce, and write original works within the entertainment and documentary narrative styles.
