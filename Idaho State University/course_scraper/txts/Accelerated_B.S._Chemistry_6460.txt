Accelerated B.S. Chemistry
Accelerated BS to MS Program
Students accepted into an accelerated undergraduate program may take departmentally approved graduate coursework as part of their undergraduate curriculum.  These credits will count towards both their bachelor's and master's degrees and can fulfill major requirements, upper-division requirements, and/or free electives.  For details on accelerated programs at Idaho State University, please see (
Degree Requirements
).
Once accepted into an
accelerated
degree program, it is strongly recommended for students to stay in close communication with their advisor regarding pursuit of acceptance into the Graduate School and the master's degree program at Idaho State University. Acceptance into an
accelerated
program during the bachelor's degree program is the first step in the admissions process. A separate application to the Graduate School is necessary for all
accelerated
programs. For more information regarding application and admission to the Graduate School at Idaho State University, please see the Graduate Admissions section of the graduate catalog (
http://coursecat.isu.edu/graduate/graduateadmissions/
).
Chemistry Accelerated Criteria
Students may be admitted to the program after having completed 64 credit hours. Application for admission must be made to the Chemistry Department. Students may replace up to 6 credits of 4400-level CHEM lecture or laboratory requirements or electives (CHEM 4400, CHEM 4407, CHEM 4433, CHEM 4437, CHEM 4438, CHEM 4445, CHEM 4447, CHEM 4470, CHEM 4499) with 5500- level analogs of these courses.  These credits will count simultaneously toward both BS and MS degree requirements for students in this program.  In addition, the student should have completed the following courses or their equivalent:
