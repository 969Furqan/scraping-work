Accelerated BS/MS Program in Mechanical Engineering
Department website:
https://www.isu.edu/me/
This acce
lerated program gives outstanding bachelor’s degree students in Mechanical
Engineering a “fast
-
track” option to pursue their Master of Scien
ce degree in
M
echanical
Engineering
or M
easurement and Control Engineering
.
In doing so, it provides a “step
-
up” for
students entering industry or areas of research and development.
The goals for this program are the same as the goals
stated
for the
MSME and MSMCE programs
described in the
graduate
catalog
.
Students accepted into the accelerated program may take up to 12 cre
dit hours of 5000-level
courses during the last two semesters of their bachelor’s program that will apply to both the
bachelor’s and master’s degree requirements. Students have to meet all requirements for both
the bachelor’s degree and master’s degree.
Additional Requirements
One of the 5000-level courses (3 credits) must be ME 5521, Engineering Modeling and
Analysis.
Students must earn at least a “B” (3.0) in each graduate
-
level course counted for the
program.
Eligibility
Completion of at least 70 undergraduate credits
applicable
to the Bachelor of
Science in Mechanical Engineering program at the time of application.
Overall GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale at the time of applicat
ion.
Completion of ME 3307, Thermodynamics, ME 3350, Mechanics of Materials, ME
3320, Kinematics, and ME 3323, Machine Design with a GPA computed for these
courses of at least 3.3 on a 4.0 scale at the time of application.
Students may submit their application while taking ME 3341, Fluid Mechanics, ME
4476, Heat Transfer,
and ME 3325, Machine Design II.
Students who wi
sh to enroll in
this program must
submit an application no later than
March
15th
of the second semester of their junior year
, as described above, to the Engineerin
g
Office
.
Meeting these eligibility requirements does not guarantee acceptance into the accelerated
master’s degree programs.
Students will be notified of their acceptance/denial into the
accelerated program.
Students must also submit an online
application to the Graduate School
no later than April 1st or November 1
st
of the semester they will complete their bachelor's degree requirements and receive a letter of admission (approved/denied) after the application review. This will facilitate the student’s reclassification as a Graduate student in the institution.
Applicants are not required to take the Graduate Record
Examination (GRE) test.
