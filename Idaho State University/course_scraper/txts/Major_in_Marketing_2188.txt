Major in Marketing
Marketing is one of the largest and most diverse areas of business. Through its various creative, communicative, and data-driven channels, the field of marketing is based around promoting and sharing the value of a product or service with the consumer. Marketers enjoy the study and understanding of influences on consumer decisions, needs and interests. This knowledge is leveraged for the development and promotion of products and services that meet those needs. Marketers might work in the areas of research, tracking and analyzing metrics, strategic planning or utilizing creative tools and materials to create solutions and attract business.
