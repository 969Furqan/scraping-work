Master of Education in Instructional Design & Technology
Graduates of the M.Ed. in Instructional Design & Technology are professionals who facilitate learning and performance through the systematic planning, creation, and assessment of technological solutions in a broad range of instructional settings and environments. MEd-ID&T candidates take courses emphasizing instructional technology and design principles, theories, methods, and applications. Mastery is demonstrated through course and program-based phase outcomes, as well as in a final field/research project for the defense of the MEd-ID&T degree. The MEd-ID&T is designed for individualized programs of study for K-12 face-to-face, blended, and online environments; post-secondary and higher education settings; and business/industry entities in support of training and consulting endeavors.
General Admission Requirements
Applicant must meet all criteria for admission to the Graduate School (application available online). In addition, the following should be submitted to complete the application process:
Letter of interest to the MEd-ID&T program coordinator
Current Curriculum Vitae or Resume including names and contact information for three references
An interview with program area faculty via in-person or video conferencing may be requested
International Student Admission Requirements
International students must apply to the Idaho State University Graduate School and meet all criteria for admission. Typically, international students cannot begin their enrollment at Idaho State University in the summer semester. International students should refer to the
Admission of International Students
section of the Graduate catalog for TOEFL and other requirements for those whose native language is not English.
General Requirements (30 - 33 credits)
Students should begin their coursework in the fall semester. It is recommended students register for two courses per semester in order to complete the degree in a timely manner. Candidates should establish a Plan of Study with their advisor prior to registering for classes. It is important to work closely with the advisor to assure a smooth progression from start to completion of the MEd-ID&T degree.
All students must complete a minimum of 33 credits in order to be granted the MEd-ID&T degree. No more than 9 credits of graduate work may be transferred from another program or university; transferred credits must meet ISU Graduate School guidelines and be approved by program area faculty. The 33 credits are distributed as follows:
12 credits in Instructional Design & Technology Foundations
15 credits of Instructional Design & Technology Specialty Studies, including 6 credits of electives
3 - 6 credits of Instructional Design & Technology Applied Field Study, including Field Project and/or Thesis
Program Assessments: At the end of
EDLT 6611
, students submit the Phase I Program Assessment that illustrates the ability to conduct analysis and design for a technological solution for an instructional issue. At the end of
EDLT 6612
, students submit the Phase II Program Assessment that illustrates the ability to develop a technological solution for an instructional issue. During the final defense, students submit the Phase III Program Assessment that illustrates the ability to use recognized instructional design and technology methods to implement and evaluate a project as a solution for an instructional issue.
Instructional Design & Technology Core Studies (12 credits)
The intent of the Instructional Design and Technology Core Studies (IDTCS) area is to promote essential and common competencies within instructional technology and design, including theories related to the instructional design knowledge base, assessment and measurement, research and writing, and statistical methods. Candidates for the MEd-ID&T degree should work closely with their Academic Advisor to identify specific content and sequencing of courses. Courses in the ID&T Core include:
EDLT 6601
,
EDLT 6611
,
EDLT 6621
, and
EDLT 6622
.
Instructional Design & Technology Specialty Studies (15 credits)
The intent of Instructional Design and Technology Specialty Studies (IDTSS) is to provide depth of knowledge and skills applicable to a wide array of professional contexts. Practical application and research in current and emerging learning technologies are emphasized. IDTSS courses meet advanced standards in planning and analysis; design and development; and implementation, assessment, and management within technology-driven environments. These courses prepare the candidate to complete the applied field studies for the MEd-ID&T degree. Courses that can be used for credits in the ID&T Specialty Studies Area include:
EDLT 6612
,
EDLT 6613
,
EDLT 6614
,
EDLT 6616
,
EDLT 6646
,
EDLT 6649
, and
EDLT 6680
.
Instructional Design & Technology Applied Field Studies (3 - 6 credits)
The intent of Instructional Design and Technology Applied Field Studies (IDTAFS) is to allow the candidate to demonstrate mastery of analysis and planning, creation and implementation, and evaluation and assessment through an independent technological project. Candidates work closely with their Academic Advisor to identify a professional context (K-12, post-secondary education, business/organization) for which they will create and apply an instructional design/technology intervention. In addition, candidates will base the intervention on instructional design theories and principles as evidenced in their culminating field project or thesis. Field studies credits are generally fulfilled by three credits of
EDLT 6651
or six credits of
EDLT 6659
.
