Post-Baccalaureate Secondary Certificate in Teacher Education
Admission Requirements
Candidates must complete a formal application to the Teacher Education program. The College approves the standards for admission. Application for admission can be completed through forms available in the Kent Student Support Center of the College of Education following the completion of
of a BA/BS from a regionally accredited institution.
Candidates may not register for courses that require admittance to Teacher Education or register for courses that have prerequisites that require admittance to Teacher Education until admission is achieved. Candidates who have been denied admittance may reapply when qualification criteria have been met; however, they must meet the current admission standards at the time of their reapplication.
Criteria for admission include the following:
A 3.0 overall grade point average including all transfer credits or credits earned in a previous degree program.
A successful background check (see above in Background Checks and Fingerprinting).
Teacher education programs are updated regularly to reflect changes to the Idaho standards and requirements. Hence, regardless of the Idaho State University Undergraduate Catalog declared for the purpose of meeting ISU graduation requirements, teacher candidates may need to meet changes to certification requirements as specified by the Idaho State Board of Education and the Idaho State Department of Education in order to be eligible for recommendation for initial teacher certification at the time of program completion.
