Master of Business Administration
Admission Requirements
The student must apply to, and meet all criteria for, admission to the Graduate School, and all additional College of Business requirements.
Admission to the MBA program is granted only to students showing high promise of success. The College of Business uses various measures to determine this likelihood. However, the minimum requirement for admission is based on the following formula:
The sum of 200 times the grade point average in the last 60 credit hours of coursework (4.0 system) plus the total score on the Graduate Management Admissions Test must equal at least 1150 points.
OR
The sum of 200 times the grade point average in the last 60 credit hours of coursework (4.0 system) plus the total score on the Graduate Management Admissions Test Focus Edition must equal at least 1120 points.
OR
The sum of 11.66 times the grade point average of the most recent 60 credit hours of coursework (4.0 system) plus the sum of the GRE Verbal Score and GRE Quantitative score must equal at least 337 points.
For applicants from schools with different grading systems a GPA will be inferred as accurately as possible. Graduate courses will be included in the most recent 60-credit hour GPA calculation. For applicants with a significant amount of recent upper-division academic course work versus course work that is considerably older, we may choose to consider only the recent GPA.
Individuals holding a current master's degree from a regionally accredited institution may meet minimum requirements and be considered for admission if they meet the Graduate School requirements, in which case the student may not be required to take the GMAT for admission.
All applicants are required to submit a resume outlining work experience, a statement of purpose, and two letters of reference.
Please note that no individual can be admitted to classified status in the MBA program until the College of Business has received the applicant’s official transcripts and official GMAT/GRE scores.
Applications are accepted at any time. Complete applications are reviewed the first working day of each month up to the Graduate School deadlines for admission.
Locations
The MBA program serves Southeast Idaho's need for part-time and full-time graduate education in business. The traditional MBA degree is offered full-time and part-time in the evenings in Pocatello. It is also offered part-time in Idaho Falls in the evenings. The program is available online on a part-time basis. Emphasis area availability varies depending on the campus. Prospective students are encouraged to check with the Director of Graduate Studies to review the current options.
Conduct
Academic integrity is expected by the College of Business. All forms of academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, are prohibited.
The penalties for students engaging in academic dishonesty, plagiarism, unprofessional or unethical conduct within the university community range from a failing grade to dismissal from the MBA program, and/or permanent expulsion from the university with notation on the student's transcript. The Graduate Catalog explains the dismissal policy and the procedures for the appeal of dismissal. If you are unclear as to what constitutes academic dishonesty, you should consult the Graduate Catalog, then review the College of Business policy on Academic Integrity available from the College of Business Office in BA 202; from the College of Business web site at
http://www.isu.edu/cob/
; or refer to the Idaho State University Faculty/Staff Handbook policy on academic dishonesty. If you are still in doubt about academic dishonesty, you are encouraged to consult with a faculty member, the Graduate Studies Director, or the Dean.

A request for an exception to the MBA-I must be made to the Director of Graduate Studies. This request should state the MBA-I courses remaining to be taken in the student’s program, when those courses will be taken, and what hardships will be incurred if the exception is not granted.
Students may substitute MBA-II courses only with permission of the College of Business Director of Graduate Studies and the appropriate department chair or program director.

Program of Study
All MBA students are required to meet with the Graduate Studies Director, who serves as the program advisor, prior to or during their initial term in the program in order to develop an approved program of study. Students will be blocked from registering for the next term until this program of study is approved. Once students have successfully met all the requirements of the program of study, they are eligible to graduate in the corresponding semester.
Academic Requirements
Any student who, after admission to the College of Business graduate program, falls below a 3.0 GPA or receives a grade of C+ or lower in the MBA program (MBA-I, MBA-II, and elective courses) is deemed to be doing unsatisfactory work and is subject to review by the College of Business MBA Administrative Committee and to possible dismissal from the program. A student dismissed for academic reasons may apply for readmission to the MBA program no earlier than four months following his/her dismissal. Requests for readmission will be denied unless the student can demonstrate that the reasons for the previous unsatisfactory work have been rectified and can show evidence of ability to perform satisfactorily in the MBA program.
Courses in which a grade of D+, D, D- or F has been earned will not be counted toward fulfillment of MBA-I or MBA-II program requirements. Students may not use more than two courses with a grade of C+, C, or C- to satisfy graduation requirements. Students must achieve a 3.0 or better GPA in order to graduate.
