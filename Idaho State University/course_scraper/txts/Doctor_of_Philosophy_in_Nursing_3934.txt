Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing
The Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing degree program in the School of Nursing (SON) at ISU prepares the student to develop and conduct scientific research and participate actively in lifelong scholarship, leadership, and education. The research emphasis is dedicated to extending the knowledge base of nursing and improving the delivery of health care for rural and vulnerable individuals, families, and communities within existing cultural, geographical, and health care contexts. An interprofessional research focus provides an opportunity for students to advance science collaborating with other professionals in identifying research opportunities, recognition of the contribution of other disciplines to the improvement of health status, open channels of communication, and prepare graduates for leading change and advancing health and health care systems.
The ISU SON enrolls students interested in improving health status in rural and other vulnerable populations and overcoming fragmented health care systems, practices, and beliefs. The future of nursing practice requires advances in theory and research to address highly complex problems through innovative solutions. The Ph.D. program prepares graduates to be full partners in health care provision and design for improving health and health care globally.
