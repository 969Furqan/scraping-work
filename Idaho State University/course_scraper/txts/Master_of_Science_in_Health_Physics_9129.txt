Master of Science in Health Physics
Admission Requirements
For admission, the student must apply to and meet all criteria for admission to the Graduate School, including a baccalaureate degree in a physical or biological science or engineering.
General Requirements
The basic program requirements are 33 credits, of which 15 credits must be at the 6600-course level. Six of the eighteen required credits may be thesis. Students who are prepared with some education and experience in Health Physics will likely not need all of the elective Health Physics courses. Therefore, the student’s program will be determined in consultation with the student’s advisor and committee and can include electives to meet his/her needs. An oral examination in defense of the thesis is required for the thesis option. A non-thesis option is also available.
