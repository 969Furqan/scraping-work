Civil Engineering Technology
Program Description
Civil engineering technicians collect and maintain field data and prepare drawings and maps  using angles, distances, elevations XYZ coordinates, contours, and volumes from earthwork. They use electronic total stations, levels, global positioning systems (GPS), unmanned aerial systems, 3D laser scanners and other instruments. They plan, design and perform construction staking tasks necessary for the construction of highways, railroads, bridges, buildings, airfields, subdivisions, and other facilities. They also perform testing and inspection tasks on the various construction operations to ensure compliance with specifications.
Aptitudes and Interests: Students will be required to learn and apply theoretical principles and technical knowledge easily, perform mathematical computations accurately, visualize shapes and forms from survey data or sketches, concentrate on details to avoid errors, and use judgment in planning work and handling problems. Students should like work of a scientific and technical nature involving preparation of maps, charts, and drawings. Students will also need an interest in learning computer aided design (CAD) and other design software on computers and working with the latest electronic computers, surveying, and testing equipment. These civil engineering technicians work as a team and must exercise tact in dealing with persons who may have opposing opinions. This field requires great precision and accuracy and workers must be willing to accept responsibility for performance in accordance with prescribed standards.
