Master of Social Work
Mission and Goals
The mission of the Master of Social Work (MSW) program is to prepare students for advanced clinical social work practice that promotes human and social well-being and advances social justice. Graduates are expected to become culturally competent and effective practitioners with professional values, evidence-based knowledge, and skills relevant to their local and global communities.
The Advanced Practice Specialization is Advanced Clinical Practice or Forensic Social Work Practice.
Derived from the program mission, the goals of the Master of Social Work Program are to prepare students:
To develop an identity that will incorporate the values, principles, and ethics of the social work profession.
To develop practice skills with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities, applying evidence-based knowledge.
To develop critical thinking skills based on scientific inquiry and research-informed practice.
To work with diverse, vulnerable, oppressed, and disadvantaged populations locally and globally.
To advance global human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice.
To gain expertise in clinically focused practice with an emphasis on children and families and forensic social work.

Admissions Requirements
Applicants can be admitted to the MSW Program with Advanced Standing if they have earned a BSW/BASW from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited BSW/BASW program within the previous 7 years and have substantial post-BSW/BASW social work practice experience. With Advanced Standing, students can complete the MSW degree in 34 credits. All other students must complete 63 credits in order to earn the MSW degree.
Most applicants are admitted for the Fall semester. However, because applicants with Advanced Standing admission have established foundational social work competency, they may be admitted for the Fall, Spring, or Summer semesters. Applicants for Advanced Standing admission should indicate which semester they intend to begin the MSW program.
All MSW applicants must have a grade point average of 3.0 or higher (on a 4-point scale), have earned an undergraduate degree prior to MSW enrollment, and submit all required application materials to the Graduate School. The MSW Admissions Committee reviews and approves all applications. Official admission is granted by the Graduate School.
