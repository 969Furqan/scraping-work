Master of Science in Psychology
Students enrolled in the Clinical and Experimental Psychology doctoral programs earn a Master's of Science in Psychology as they work towards their doctorate, for course work completed along the way. This is not a stand-alone Master of Science in Psychology program.
Admission Requirements
In addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School, the applicant must:
1. Have a minimum 3.0 grade point average (preferred not required) during the last two years of undergraduate study.
2. A Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts with an undergraduate major in psychology or the equivalent.
3. Passing grades in undergraduate courses in research methods and statistics.
4. Sufficient exposure to fundamental core areas in psychology to be successful at the graduate level.
5. Recommendation by the Experimental or Clinical Admissions Committee of the Department of Psychology. The Clinical and Experimental Admissions Committees only admit students into the combined Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy course of study.
General Requirements
The MS in Psychology degree is earned after the successful completion of at least 36 semester credit hours of approved course work. Students deficient in area prerequisites may be required to enroll in additional course work and/or experience limitation of choices. Students admitted by the Clinical Admissions Committee must complete the Clinical Area Requirements, but may waive one Area requirement course if they passed an advanced undergraduate course (or courses) that provided broad exposure to subject matter addressed in that course. Course materials must be reviewed and approved by a content expert in the department before permission to waive a course is given. Students admitted by the Experimental Admissions Committee must complete the Experimental Area Requirements. Students admitted by either committee cannot earn more than one master’s degree in Psychology.
