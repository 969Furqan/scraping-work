Minor in Sociology
A Minor in Sociology is a strong addition to any major, providing a solid foundation of innovative perspectives to understand human behavior. Students learn analytical skills to examine our diverse world and think critically about social issues that impact their daily lives. A student who completes a Minor in Sociology will have honed skills not only favorable to employers but can also apply those skills to improve the lives of those in their community.
