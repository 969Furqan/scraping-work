B.S. Nuclear Engineering
Nuclear engineering is a field with exciting and expanding opportunities. Careers range from operating nuclear power plants to research for the future of nuclear reactor design, nuclear fuels, reprocessing and waste disposal.  Other areas include space propulsion, medical treatment and homeland security applications.  Job prospects in nuclear engineering are good, with opportunities as close as the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and spanning across the U.S. and the world.  Salaries for nuclear engineers are among the highest for all engineering professions. Graduates with a B.S. may start at an annual income greater than $60,000.
Students earning this degree must complete 8 of the 9 University General Education Objectives (a minimum of 36 credits - see the
General Education Requirements
described in the Academic Information section of this catalog).  The program of study for the Bachelor of Science in Nuclear Engineering degree totals 122 credits (minimum) as follows.  Some of the required courses also satisfy or partially satisfy General Education Objectives, as noted.
