Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering and Applied Science (MMCE)
The interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Engineering and Applied Science (EAS) is a unique program providing students with substantial depth in one branch of engineering or science as well as a broad base of interdisciplinary knowledge needed for the technological challenges of today. Students choose a primary concentration from the Department of Mechanical and Measurement & Control Engineering within the College of Science & Engineering.
Admission Requirements
In addition to the Graduate School Admission requirements, acceptance into the Mechanical Engineering or Measurement & Control Engineering concentration requires the following:
Mechanical Engineering Concentration
Completed or in the process of completing a master’s degree in engineering, applied science or equivalent field
GPA 3.0
A faculty advisor
Measurement & Control Engineering Concentration
Completed or in the process of completing a master’s degree in engineering, applied science or equivalent field
GPA 3.0
A faculty advisor
General Admission Requirements
If not all requirements are met, the Mechanical and Measurement & Control Engineering Department may choose to admit the candidate to "Classified (with performance requirements)" status. Applicants admitted as "Classified (with performance requirements)" status will be required to rectify any deficiencies determined by the student's Program Director (or Coordinator) and the Chair of the Department.
The candidate must submit:
All official college/university transcripts;
Three letters of recommendation;
A one-page statement including research/career interests and goals as well as a preferred area of concentration;
A resume or curriculum vitae
Course Requirements
The Ph.D. Advisory Committee will guide the student in establishing his or her Program of Study based upon the student’s background and research interests to satisfy doctoral-level coursework. In addition, the committee will evaluate the level of the student’s preparation in his or her area of research as well as the background in his/her sub-disciplines needed to successfully complete courses toward a PhD.
In addition to the Graduate School requirements, the Department of Mechanical and Measurement and Control Engineering requires the following:
For each semester the student takes a graduate seminar, the student must:
Attend the presentations given by other graduate students, or attend other professional talks, seminars, etc.,
Make a brief report of half a page on each of the seminar presentations
A minimum of 9 credits per semester is required in order for a student to qualify as a full-time Graduate teaching/research assistant (GTA/GRA).
Research Requirements
A complete dissertation, containing the results of relevant and original research, formatted according to the guidelines of the Graduate School and approved by the PhD Advisory Committee; and an oral presentation approved by the PhD Advisory Committee.
Dissemination Requirement
At least 1 article in an international, peer-reviewed journal accepted for publication, or 3 contributions to international, peer-reviewed conferences accepted for presentation at the time of graduation.
