B.S. Surveying and Geomatics Engineering Technology
To declare a major in Surveying and Geomatics Engineering Technology
Bachelor of Science degree, a student must have completed a two-year degree in Civil Engineering Technology at ISU, a similar two-year degree from another ABET accredited program, or have permission of the program coordinator. For further details, please consult faculty of the Surveying and Geomatics Engineering Technology program.
This degree builds upon the knowledge a student has gained through the pursuit of an earned two-year degree in Civil Engineering Technology from an ABET accredited program. The student's prior coursework must include the prerequisite math needed to enroll in
MATH 1170
Calculus I.  It is recommended that prior coursework also include a 3 credit statistics course as this is a prerequisite for
GEMT 3315
Surveying Adjustments.  The student's previous degree will be evaluated by the program coordinator to determine eligibility for entrance into the Surveying and Geomatics Engineering Technology Bachelor of Science  program.  Up to 41 credits of coursework from the prior two-year degree may be awarded toward completion of the Surveying and Geomatics Engineering Technology Bachelor of Science degree.  If the two-year degree is over 5 years old, the student must be evaluated for currency in the technical field.
