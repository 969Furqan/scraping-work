Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership
Admission Requirements
Admission to the Educational Leadership doctoral program is based on a rolling-cohort model. Cohorts cycle through approximately every three years. Screening of applications for cohort admission begins April 15th of the year in which a cohort is scheduled to begin the program. Outside the cohort, applications are invited on an ongoing basis. Non-cohort applications are reviewed in fall, spring, and summer. Every effort is made to support the doctoral program of study of non-cohort students.
At the time of application, the applicant must specify a single area of concentration (i.e., P-12 Education Administration, Higher Education Administration, Instructional Design and Technology). Should a student wish to change his or her area of concentration, he or she must reapply to the Graduate School for readmission to the doctoral program in Educational Leadership.
For admission to the Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership, the student must apply to and meet the criteria for admission to the Graduate School. The applicant must also meet the following minimum admission requirements:
A master’s degree in education or a related field from a regionally accredited institution with a minimum of a 3.5 grade point average in the graduate-level coursework
Letter of interest, stating why the applicant is interested in the Ed.D. (specify concentration)
A minimum score at the 40th percentile on the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) or on either the Verbal Reasoning or Analytical Writing section on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)
A current resume that includes the names of two professional references who can address the academic or professional/leadership qualifications of the applicant
Successful completion of an interview with faculty in the proposed concentration area
Successful performance of a writing sample completed in conjunction with the interview
International students whose native language is not English must comply with Graduate School admissions requirements. Additional language-based course work may be required of international students whose native language is not English.

The Educational Leadership program defines cognate study as a planned set of courses, 5500-level and above, outside the student’s concentration area, taken within the College of Education or outside it. Cognate study is to be determined prior to cognate course enrollment, in consultation with the student’s advisor.
Of the 61/64 semester credits required for the Ed.D. in Educational Leadership, at least 30 semester credits of course work must be taken at Idaho State University. Dissertation credits may not be transferred from another institution.
Students are required to maintain continuous enrollment of at least one semester credit of work each semester (including summers) from matriculation to completion of the program including completion of the dissertation and oral defense. Failure to maintain continuous enrollment can result in dismissal from the program.
Students must maintain a 3.2 grade point average to qualify for the Doctor of Education. Two grades of C+ or below during the entire program will result in admissions status review, with the possibility of dismissal.
Final Program of Study
Tentative programs of study may be drafted upon program entry with the help of the student’s advisor. The final program of study must be submitted with the Comprehensive Examination Notice of Intent and routed through the student’s advisor, the Department, and the Dean of the College of Education. Upon submission of the final program of study to the Dean of the Graduate School, the Dissertation Committee, including the Graduate Faculty Representative, is established and the student is advanced to candidacy.
Comprehensive Examination
The comprehensive examination is a significant aspect of the student’s total doctoral program. The written examination is normally administered during or immediately following the last semester in which the student is engaged in formal course work.
The comprehensive examination has, as its overall objective, the assessment of the student’s knowledge, understanding, and skills as they relate to the field of educational leadership. Examination guidelines are provided in the Ed.D. Handbook.
Dissertation and Oral Defense
Upon successful completion of the comprehensive examination and approval of the dissertation proposal by the student's Dissertation Committee, the student is authorized to complete the dissertation in preparation for the final oral defense.
