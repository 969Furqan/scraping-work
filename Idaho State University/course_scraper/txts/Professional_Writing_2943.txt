Professional Writing
Professional Writing Major
The Professional Writing program concentrates on technical and business writing, media studies, and writing in professional settings. Students build a foundation in writing for a variety of audiences, master language and writing skills, and develop their critical and analytical thinking.
Our professors have worked as professional or technical writers in the professional world. They bring real-world into the classroom. Professional writing students also complete a 75-hour
internship
.
A student with this degree could go on to a career in technical writing, communication, media, journalism, editing, design, business, or public relations. Alumni from our undergraduate program have worked as scientists, journalists, graphic designers, editors, authors, and web content managers.
