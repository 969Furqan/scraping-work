MBA and PharmD Joint Degree Program
Department website:
https://www.isu.edu/pharmacy/current-students/pharmd-students/dual-degree-programs/
Admission Requirements
Admission to the MBA program will normally take place at the end of the second professional year. PharmD students must meet the regular admission requirements of the MBA program except they are required to have completed only the equivalent of an undergraduate degree at the time of admission. Applicants must request the College of Pharmacy to certify to the Graduate School that the student has completed 120 hours and that those 120 hours are equivalent to an undergraduate degree.
Waiver of Requirements
Course requirements will be waived for students who can demonstrate that they have taken equivalent courses within the last 5 years. If a course is waived, the student is required to substitute an alternative course in the field of study that was waived. Waiver of courses and substitutions must be approved by the MBA Director.
Academic Requirements
Any student who, after admission to the College of Business certificate program, falls below a 3.0 GPA or receives two C+ grades or a grade of D or F in any course is deemed to be doing unsatisfactory work and is subject to dismissal from the program. A student dismissed for academic reasons may apply for readmission to the certificate program no earlier than four months following his/her dismissal. Requests for readmission will be denied unless the student can demonstrate that the reasons for the previous unsatisfactory work have been rectified and he/she shows evidence of ability to perform satisfactorily in the certificate program. Courses in which a grade of D or F has been earned will not be counted toward fulfillment of program requirements. Students may not use more than two courses with a grade of C+ to satisfy certificate completion requirements.
Program Requirements
Students enrolled in the PharmD Program at Idaho State University may combine that degree program with an MBA degree with approximately one year of additional effort. The program is essentially the traditional MBA degree program with the use of some PharmD courses to meet MBA requirements.
