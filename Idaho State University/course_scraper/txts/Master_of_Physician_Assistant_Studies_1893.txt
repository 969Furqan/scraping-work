Technical Standards
All entering students must meet the required list of Technical Standards.

Curriculum
The ISU PA Program Graduate Curriculum is twenty-four (24) months in length, divided into twelve (12) months of didactic (3 semesters) and twelve (12) months of clinical education (3 semesters).
The Didactic Curriculum is comprised of foundation courses in the fall semester, followed in the spring and summer semesters by modules that provide an immersion experience in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases commonly encountered in primary care medicine.
Elective coursework in Medical Spanish is available to Physician Assistant students. The Department of Global Studies and Languages offers a graduate certificate in Spanish for Health Professions along with other elective courses. This is an excellent opportunity for students as well as graduates to enhance their credentials.
Clinical Year Rotation goals are designed to meet the needs of the student and to address the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA) accreditation standards. The Clinical Year staff places students in eight rotations that best address PA student educational objectives and at sites that promote continued, quality, preceptor relations with the ISU PA Program. There are seven required content areas, including Internal Medicine, Outpatient Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine, Surgery, and Psychiatry. One rotation will be an elective. Students are expected to travel during the clinical year and to pay for the expenses incurred for this travel.
There are three Capstone Assessment Courses in the second year of the PA Program. Together they represent a comprehensive assessment of the students. The Capstone Assessment III course is the third one in the series and students are required to study for and pass multiple objective examinations.

Additional Opportunities for MPAS Students
The PA Program has developed the Latino Health Track and the Rural Health Track to pair alongside the MPAS curriculum, allowing students to take part in additional training opportunities designed to increase graduate marketability and better serve the health care needs of our state, region, and country.
Regardless of whether an MPAS student is accepted into one of the below Health Tracks, MPAS students are welcome to pursue additional Graduate Certificates alongside their MPAS curriculum. The Spanish for Health Professions and Lifestyle Medicine certificates are particularly designed with MPAS students in mind, in joint cooperation with Dr. Helen Tarp, Director of the SHP Program, and other interprofessional health sciences programs.
Hispanic Health Track
Admitted MPAS students are able to apply for the Hispanic Health Track through an internal application administered by the PA Program that opens each summer. A maximum of nine students are accepted, taking into consideration Spanish language ability, volunteerism, and dedication to serving Hispanic populations after graduation. Students who are admitted to the Hispanic Health Track pursue the
Graduate Certificate in Spanish for Health Professions
(SHP) from the Department of Global Studies and Languages alongside their MPAS curriculum. They will complete a 10-week primary care rotation in a Hispanic-dense clinic or location. More information is available at
isu.edu/pa/admission/medical-spanish-opportunities
.
Rural Health Track
Admitted MPAS students are able to apply for the Rural Health Track through an internal application administered by the PA Program that opens each summer. A maximum of twelve students are accepted, taking into consideration dedication to serving rural populations after graduation. Students who are admitted to the Rural Health Track pursue one of four possible Graduate Certificates alongside their MPAS curriculum: Lifestyle Medicine, Spanish for Health Professions,
Interprofessional Geriatric
, or
Rural Health
. Several of their PA rotations are also guaranteed to be in rural locations. They also become AHEC Scholars, receiving additional education around health inequities, disparities, and social determinants of health in rural communities. More information is available at
isu.edu/pa/admission/rht
.
International Rotation and Medical Mission Experiences
MPAS students are eligible to participate in two medical missions to Spanish-speaking countries (Dominican Republic and Peru) and an international clinical rotation in Belize. International experiences are strictly voluntary. Credit in the SHP Program is available for these experiences.
