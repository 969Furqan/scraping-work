"I truly would not be where I am today if it wasn’t for the constant support  from the Criminology department at ISU. Now, I am a strategy and transformation consultant focusing on mass violence and domestic terrorism within the national security segment. I
feel that there was no better place
than
the ISU Criminology
department
for me
to
kick off my career."
