MS in Clinical Psychopharmacology
Becoming a Prescribing Psychologist
At Idaho State University's College of Pharmacy Master of Science in Clinical Psychopharmacology program, students explore drug effects on behavior and brain health. Through the MSCP program, licensed psychologists delve into evidence-based practices to address various psychological disorders. The MSCP program, designated by the American Psychological Association (APA), ensures rigorous training in medication usage as part of treatment strategies. This recognition underscores ISU's commitment to maintaining the highest academic and training standards, preparing students to excel in their professional endeavors. ISU accommodates diverse learners through traditional and distance learning, preparing graduates to excel professionally. Through personalized experiences, MSCP students understand drug mechanisms and their impact on mental health.
About the Master of Science in Clinical Psychopharmacology
The Idaho State University Master of Science in Clinical Psychopharmacology (MSCP) is a post-doctoral program designed to equip licensed psychologists with the necessary expertise to safely and effectively utilize psychotropic medication in their practice. The program offers two distinct tracks tailored to meet the needs of diverse professionals within the field of clinical psychology.
Through rigorous coursework and practical training, students in both tracks acquire a deep understanding of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, enabling them to diagnose and treat various mental illnesses in adults with precision. They gain insights into the efficacy, effectiveness, and potential risks associated with different psychotropic medications. Additionally, they learn to assess individual responses to medication, considering factors such as dose, exposure, and individual pharmacological properties.
MS in Clinical Psychopharmacology Prescriptive Authority Preparation - Track 1
The first track is a comprehensive program encompassing additional clinical training hours and synchronous coursework, aimed explicitly at psychologists seeking to expand their scope of practice to include medication prescription. This track provides in-person instruction at the Idaho State University-Meridian Sam and Aline Skaggs Health Science Center in Meridian, Idaho. Here, students benefit from hands-on training facilitated by the esteemed clinical faculty from the Department of Clinical Psychopharmacology in the L.S. Skaggs College of Pharmacy. This unique setup offers essential clinical services to the community through the Integrated Mental Health Clinic and serves as an invaluable training ground for aspiring psychologists.
MS in Clinical Psychopharmacology Didactic Coursework Only - Track 2
The second track is an online, didactic-only option, allowing for flexibility in learning through asynchronous coursework. This track, which admitted its inaugural cohort in the Fall 2022 semester, caters to psychologists who prefer a more flexible learning environment while still gaining essential knowledge in psychopharmacology.
