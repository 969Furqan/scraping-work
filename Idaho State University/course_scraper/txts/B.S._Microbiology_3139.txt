B.S. Microbiology
The purpose of the BS in Microbiology is to serve students who seek to develop a strong background in microbiology and molecular biology, with applications for biotechnology, medical, and environmental biology. Majors gain experiences that prepare them to participate in the development of research plans and their implementation, and to be competent to carry out standard microbiological and molecular biology techniques in the laboratory. The BS in Microbiology prepares students to be competitive for positions in research, graduate schools, health professional schools, and in the biotechnology industry.
Core Requirements
Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree must satisfy the
General Education Objectives
(a minimum of 37 credits). Students must also satisfy the core requirements listed below and at least
13
credits of elective courses in Microbiology. (Need 36 upper division course hours.) In order to make timely progress toward the degree, it is imperative that the student work closely with a major advisor.
