A.S. Health Physics
Admission to this program requires approval of the Department Chair.
The objective of the Idaho State University program that awards an Associate of Science in Health Physics is to develop an individual to assume the role of a health physics technician (sometimes referred to as Radiological Control Technician or RCT) with the knowledge in radiological and biological sciences appropriate for this career option. That same knowledge serves as the basis for certification by the National Registry of Radiation Protection Technologist (NRRPT). Students completing this program will develop the fundamental skills important to life-long learning and advancing within the discipline of Health Physics.
Students must fulfill 8 of the 9 University General Education Requirements (a minimum of 36 credits--see the
General Education Requirements
described in the Academic Information section of this catalog.)
