Accelerated BSHS/MOT
Admission Requirements
Undergraduate students at ISU may also have the option of early pre-professional entry into the program through the established guidelines of the Bachelor of Science in Health Science, Pre-Occupational Therapy Accelerated Concentration.
During the first three years, these undergraduate students develop a course of study that will meet the student's interests, university degree requirements, and Occupational Therapy Program prerequisites admission requirements. The student can then apply to the BSHS program during his/her junior year. With the completion of the first professional year in the OT program, the student will receive a Bachelor of Science in Health Science and will continue directly into the MOT program over the next two years. The combination of the BSHS degree with the MOT degree program creates a seamless entry into the occupational therapy profession, ensuring that all prerequisites in social, physical, and biological sciences are completed in a timely manner. For further information on the BSHS and Occupational Therapy program, contact the Department of Occupational Therapy at

Curriculum
The below two curriculum tables demonstrate how students use the coursework taken in their senior undergraduate year, referred to here as the "Pre-Professional Year," as a bridge from the Bachelor of Science in Health Science Pre-Occupational Therapy Concentration program into the Master of Occupational Therapy program.  This option is only available to admitted MOT graduate students who were previously accepted into and successfully completed the BSHS with Pre-Occupational Therapy Concentration program.  Students begin the Master of Occupational Therapy curriculum in the summer following the completion of the Pre-Professional Year.  Contact the department for more details related to admission into and completion of this unique accelerated program.
