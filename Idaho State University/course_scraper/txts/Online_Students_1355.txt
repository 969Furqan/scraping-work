Frequently Asked Questions
Can the MLS Program be completed online?
What is clinical sponsorship?
Can any laboratory serve as a sponsor?
What is required of a sponsor lab?
What is an affiliation agreement?
Yes! Both the Bachelors and Masters level programs can be completed
100% remotely
as long as the following two criteria are met:
The applicant has laboratory sponsorship
There is an affiliation agreement between ISU and the sponsor laboratory
Sponsorship indicates that a clinical laboratory has agreed to be responsible for the online student's hands-on instruction. This includes:
Weekly laboratory instruction (typically 6-8 hours a week) during the Fall and Spring semesters.
Sponsor the 12-week clinical rotations at the end of the MLS professional block of courses (typically the third and final summer semester).
Sponsor laboratories must have the capability to cover all areas of instruction, including Hematology, Chemistry, Urinalysis, Microbiology, and Blood Bank.
All other course work in the program is 100% online.
Any clinical laboratory may serve as a sponsor, under two conditions:
Sponsor laboratories must have the capability to cover all areas of instruction, including Hematology, Chemistry, Urinalysis, Microbiology, and Blood Bank.
A successful affiliation agreement must executed between the sponsor laboratory and Idaho State University.
Sponsorship indicates that a clinical laboratory has agreed to be responsible for the online student's hands-on instruction. This includes:
Weekly laboratory instruction (typically 6-8 hours a week) during the Fall and Spring semesters.
Sponsor the 12-week clinical rotations in all subject areas at the end of the MLS professional block of courses (typically the third and final summer semester).
For more information on the specifics of sponsor laboratory duties, please contact Rachel Hulse at rachelhulse@isu.edu
The sponsor laboratory must have a formal affiliation agreement with Idaho State University which describes the educational duties of the student.
An affiliation agreement is a legal document between Idaho State University and the sponsor laboratory that details:
the relationship of the entities
the roles of the entities
the responsibilities of the sponsor and Idaho State University
the assurance for completion of students assigned clinical requirements in the event that an affiliation is discontinued
Idaho State University has a standard affiliation agreement, although site-specific agreements are also allowed. In order to obtain an affiliation agreement, please contact Rachel Hulse rachelhulse@isu.edu.
