B.S. Geology with Engineering Geology Concentration
The B.S. degree is offered for undergraduates who wish to become professional ­geoscientists either after their bachelor’s degree or after subsequent graduate study.
It trains students in the essential observational and analytical skills of field geology as well as more applied areas of microscope petrology, geochemistry, and geo
technology. The B.S. degree is designed to give the student a broad and comprehensive understanding of the discipline of geology and a firm background in math, physics, and ­chemistry.
