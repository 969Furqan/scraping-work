B.A. Biology with Biology Education Concentration
The B.A. in Biology with a Concentration in Biology Education is designed for students who want to pursue teacher certification in biology. The B.A. has fewer courses in Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics than the B.S. in Biology, and more upper division electives, providing students with greater latitude to design their own program of study. Students who pursue the B.A. in Biology
will not meet the minimum requirements
for admission to most graduate research programs in biological sciences or professional programs in the health sciences.
The B.A. degree requires that students complete all of the
General Education Objectives
described in the Academic Information section of this catalog.  Students must also satisfy the core requirements listed below and the requirements of the Biology Education Concentration.  All graduates of this degree program will earn a B.A. in Biology regardless of the concentration selected.
General Education
The listing below includes program requirements that also fulfill General Education requirements.

Concentration in Biology Education
(Idaho teacher
preparation requires 45 credits
of Biology in the Single Subject Major)
Students in the B.A. in Biology program with the Concentration in Biology Education may complete the requirements for teacher certification by completing the Professional Education Core and other required courses in the College of Education. Such students must apply for admission to the Teacher Education program (see the College of Education section of the catalog for details).
In addition to completing the Required Core courses and the
General Education Requirements
, students earning a B.A. in Biology in the Biological Education concentration must complete the following requirements.
