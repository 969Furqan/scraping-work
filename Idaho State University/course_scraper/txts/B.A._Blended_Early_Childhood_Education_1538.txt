The goal of the Early Childhood Education Program is to prepare professionals who have the necessary knowledge, dispositions, and abilities to:
Enhance learning and development of young children, with and without disabilities, between the ages of birth and third grade.
Establish collaborative relationships with families and other professionals in ways that produce outcomes for young children.
View their own professional development as a lifelong endeavor.
Advocate for children, families, and the early childhood profession.
The Baccalaureate degree in the Early Childhood Education program is designed to further prepare Early Childhood Education professionals holding either an Associate of Arts (A.A.), Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.), or Associate of Science (A.S.) in the field of early childhood education. Early Childhood Education is the study and education of young children from birth through third grade.
