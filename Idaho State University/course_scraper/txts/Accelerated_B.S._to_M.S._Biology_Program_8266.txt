Accelerated B.S. to M.S. Biology Program
This accelerated program gives outstanding bachelor’s degree students in Biology a “fast-track” option to pursue their Master of Science in Biology degree.
Students accepted into the accelerated program may take up to 8 credit hours of 5000-level courses during the last two semesters of their bachelor’s program that will apply to both the bachelor’s and master’s degree requirements.  Students have to meet all requirements for both the bachelor’s degree and master’s degree.
Additional requirements for students in this program are:
1.       Students need to identify a suitable advisor for their MS program (see  https://www.isu.edu/biology/degree-programs/graduate-degrees/ms-biology/).
2.       Students must earn at least a “B” (3.0) in each graduate-level course counted for the program.
Eligibility for this program:
1.       Completion of at least 70 undergraduate credits
applicable
to the Bachelor of Science in Biology program at the time of application.
2.       Overall GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale at the time of application.
Students who wish to enroll in this program should apply no later than the end of the second semester of their junior year.  Applicants are not required to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test.
