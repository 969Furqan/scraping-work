Certificate in Idaho Dental Education Program (IDEP)
Certificate in Idaho Dental Education Program (IDEP)
The Department of Dental Sciences administers the Idaho Dental Education Program (IDEP) for pre-doctoral dental students, and the Idaho Advanced General Dentistry Residency (IAGD) as a postdoctoral program.
The Idaho Dental Education Program is designed to provide residents of Idaho with access to a high-quality dental education as if Idaho had its own dental school. The IDEP program is fully accredited as a Satellite Program of Creighton University School of Dentistry by the American Dental Association. The program involves a first year curriculum at Idaho State University in Pocatello, followed by completion of the second through fourth years at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. Students completing the four year program receive the Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) degree and are eligible to take the licensure examinations necessary to become a practicing dentist. Students may also elect to pursue advanced training through residencies or specialty programs, eventually becoming board certified in one of the recognized dental specialties.
There are eight positions available for Idaho residents. Applicants to the program must have completed the necessary prerequisites in English, Biology, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physics, and other requirements as outlined in the Department of Dental Science Bulletin. In addition to fulfilling the minimal prerequisites, most students accepted into the program will have a bachelor's degree at the time of entry into IDEP. Occasionally, some exceptional students who have completed the junior level (upper division) of college course work are admitted into the program.
Students are encouraged to work closely with their pre-dental academic advisor in making course selections that fulfill dental school and degree completion requirements.
Formal application for admission to the IDEP program follows the guidelines printed in the Department of Dental Sciences Bulletin and the Creighton University School of Dentistry Bulletin. The application process involves: taking the Dental Aptitude Test (DAT), completion of the American Dental Education Association Application Service centralized application, the Creighton Supplemental Application, and the IDEP Residency Certification Form. Although the application process can be completed as late as January 1 of the year the student plans to enter the program, earlier application is strongly encouraged to allow adequate time for completion of admission requirements and consideration by the admission committee.
IDEP PROGRAM OUTCOMES:
Students, upon program completion at Creighton University, will:
demonstrate appropriate ethical reasoning and professional responsibility.
demonstrate appropriate problem-solving skills relative to comprehensive dental patient care.
demonstrate appropriate treatment planning for all patients;
enhance oral and general health of dental patients within the community.
demonstrate appropriate management of periodontal issues.
demonstrate appropriate management of endodontic issues.
demonstrate appropriate management of oral, bone, occlusal, and temporomandibular disorders.
demonstrate appropriate management of oral surgical procedures.
demonstrate appropriate management of dental emergencies.
restore defective and/or missing teeth to appropriate form and function.
