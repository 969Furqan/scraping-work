General Requirements
The Idaho State University Master of Science in Clinical Psychopharmacology (MSCP) is a post-doctoral program intended to train clinical psychologists in the safe and effective use of psychotropic medication. The program admits licensed psychologists full-time or part-time in either a track to train psychologists who intend to prescribe medications that include additional clinical training hours and synchronous coursework; or an online, didactic-only track that includes asynchronous coursework.
The curriculum is equivalent to two full-time years of coursework and is divided into two academic years, including coursework and supervised clinical experiences. The didactic curriculum is comprised of foundational courses in basic sciences, pharmacology, and physical assessment in the first year, followed by integrated psychopharmacotherapeutic courses in the second year. Topics in law, research and writing, and practice management are also included.
Supervised clinical experiences are required in both years of the curriculum in the synchronous/prescribing track to ensure adequate and appropriately timed patient care activities and supervised prescribing of psychotropic medications. Clinical experiences are optional for asynchronous/online didactic track.
A complete list of professional/technical standards covering essential capacities for observation, communication, sensory and motor function, behavioral and social attributes, and other student performance requirements is available from the program.
