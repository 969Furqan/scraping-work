The Community Health Worker Academic Certificate is offered by the Department of Community and Public Health under the College of Health. This academic certificate meets the needs of community health workers who wish to pursue training that will prepare them to work in the growing Community Health Worker occupation. Community Health Workers are increasingly recognized as valuable members of the health system that has increased in Idaho and across the nation in response to the Affordable Care Act and a national shift toward value-based care. Community Health Workers who successfully complete this certificate will be prepared to assume a position as a community health worker in clinic or community settings and assist in the development and implementation of community health programs within their community.
Career Development and Professional Growth
Community Health Workers partner with local public health agencies and primary care and specialty care providers to address social determinants of health among community members. They also assess and evaluate community services and systems in order to identify gaps in, and serve as a resource for, healthcare services in both urban and rural, medically underserved communities. Community Health Workers are a part of a multidisciplinary team that includes physicians, nurses, social workers, discharge planners, pharmacists, and other members of the healthcare team. Community Health Workers help individuals and communities overcome barriers that prevent them from accessing and benefitting from healthcare services. They serve as advocates, health educators, counselors, system navigators, case managers, facilitators, liaisons, community brokers, and resource coordinators. They also provide prevention and outreach education on a variety of health issues including, oral and mental health, at the individual and community level. The overall goal of the community health workers is mentoring and empowering citizens, communities, and healthcare systems to achieve positive outcomes and to reach optimal levels of wellness for everyone.
