Speech-Language Pathology Program Learning Outcomes
Graduates of the Speech-Language Pathology Graduate Program will:
Demonstrate the ability to interpret, integrate, and synthesize core concepts and knowledge in evidence-based assessment and treatment for individuals with communication and swallowing disorders.
Communicate effectively, recognizing the needs, values, preferred model of communication, and cultural/linguistic background of the client/patient, family, caregivers, and relevant others.
Apply and integrate professional standards, practices, and ethics in clinical practice and research.
Incorporate critical thinking and decision-making skills while engaged in identification, evaluation, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and/or intervention.
Have demonstrated knowledge of basic human communication and swallowing processes, including the appropriate biological, neurological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural bases as well as demonstrated the ability to integrate information pertaining to normal and abnormal human development across the lifespan.
International Students
Applicants, whose first language is not English, need to meet the following TOEFL requirements for Classified admission:
Internet -based test (iBT): a total score of 80 with a score of at least 20 on each Section (graduate assistants who teach courses must score 23 or above on the Speaking Section) on the iBT; or
Computer-based test: a total score of 213 with a score of at least 21 on Section 1 (Listening Comprehension) on the computer test; or
Paper-based test: a total score of 550 with a score of at least 55 on Section l (Listening Comprehension) on the paper test or a score of 84 on the MTELP, or a score of 6 on the IELTS. Once admitted, non-native English-speaking students must also receive a passing score on a test of spoken English to participate in clinic.
*We do not accept IEI nor ELS in lieu of TOEFL/IELTS.

An adequate undergraduate background is assumed for entry to the graduate curriculum in Speech-Language Pathology. If deficiencies are found, such as lack of a basic course, the student may be required to make up the course. Note also that undergraduate or graduate courses in 1) statistics 2) psychology, sociology, or anthropology 3) physics or chemistry and 4) biology are required if not previously taken in an undergraduate program, as is Interdisciplinary Evaluation Team.
Students in the Graduate Program in Speech-Language Pathology must have the following ISU courses or their equivalents from another institution, or provide evidence from course syllabi that the basic information was covered in their undergraduate program.

General Requirements
Students must pass written and oral comprehensive examinations. For the Master of Science in Speech-Language Pathology, the written exam may be fulfilled by a portfolio and either a capstone or a thesis option. Examinations for students choosing the portfolio and capstone track are conducted internally through the department, while students choosing to do a portfolio and a thesis will require a Graduate Faculty Representative and will follow ISU Graduate School policies for thesis and dissertation.
In addition to taking 12 credits of clinical practicum (CSD 6602 or CSD 6604) in the department, all graduate students must complete an 8 credit, minimum eight-week, full-time externship (CSD 6606) with a ASHA certified SLP with at least two years of experience beyond Clinical Fellowship. Graduate students deemed by the faculty not to have made satisfactory progress in the acquisition of clinical skills may be required to enroll for further credits in clinical practicum in addition to the minimum required of all students.
According to University regulations, no student may be granted a graduate degree who does not have a 3.0 grade point average upon completion of all academic work (reference ISU Graduate Catalog). In addition, the SLP Program will follow the Graduate School’s policies of pending dismissal and dismissal (
http://coursecat.isu.edu/graduate/generalinfoandpolicies/appealsanddismissals/
) from the graduate program of any student who has received grades of “C+” or lower in two or more courses, or if that student’s overall GPA falls below 3.0 after completion of 12 or more credits of coursework (including clinic). Grades for one or more credits of clinical practicum are given equal consideration with grades obtained from academic courses.
Students that still need to complete ASHA required undergraduate courses (not included on the SLP Program of Study) to obtain certification upon completion of the clinical fellowship (e.g. physical science or statistic courses) are encouraged to complete these courses during their graduate program and must receive a C- or above in these courses (these grades will not be considered for dismissal or impact the requisite 3.0+ GPA). Students accepted to the graduate program must receive a B- or above in all program prerequisite undergraduate courses prior to or during the graduate program. Students may not take ASHA required courses while completing their externship during their final semester in the program.
In individual cases, a more stringent policy of minimum allowable grades may be applied, as in the case of students admitted with performance requirements. If a student’s graduate education is dismissed for reasons of poor academic performance, they may reapply for admission to the Graduate School and a different program no sooner than one full semester following the semester of the termination. Readmission to the terminated program is not an option. Reapplication to the Graduate School would be to seek admission to another graduate level program within Idaho State University.
