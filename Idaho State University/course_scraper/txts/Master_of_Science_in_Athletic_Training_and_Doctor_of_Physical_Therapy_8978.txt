Master of Science in Athletic Training and Doctor of Physical Therapy
Master of Science in Athletic Training / Doctorate of Physical Therapy
The MSAT/DPT dual degree pathway is a unique pathway for select students. Normally, obtaining both degrees would take a total of 5 years, but with the dual degree, the program can be completed in 4 (47 months), graduating with an MSAT and DPT degree, as well as completion of requirements to sit for the national board examinations for both professions. Both the MSAT and DPT programs are accredited by the respective governing bodies. This pathway has been approved by the Idaho State Board of Education.
Admission Requirements
Applicants must be admitted to both programs (MSAT and DPT) separately. The applicant will use the normal application (PTCAS for the DPT; ATCAS for the MSAT program). Application for the DPT Program is due October 1 and the application for the MSAT Program is due November 15. In addition, a letter must be submitted to both programs declaring interest in the dual degree pathway by November 15
th
.
Once an applicant has applied and is accepted for both programs, the DPT entrance will be deferred 1 year; the first year of the program will be entirely MSAT content.
Deposits for BOTH programs would need to be made by the deadline for each program.
Awarding of Degrees
Both degrees will be awarded at the end of the entire program (47 months). The candidate may be eligible to sit for the Athletic Training Board of Certification examination during the last academic semester of the entire program and for the National Physical Therapy Examination during the final clinical semester.
Course Sequence
The MSAT sequence will consist of the first summer session and two semesters. The DPT sequence follows for six semesters plus two summer sessions.
