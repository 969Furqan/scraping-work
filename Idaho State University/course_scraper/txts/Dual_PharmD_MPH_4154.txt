Dual PharmD/MPH
Students enrolled in the PharmD/MPH Program at Idaho State University may combine the PharmD degree with an MPH degree with approximately one year of additional effort. There are no changes to the existing programs, nor does it replace any existing programs. The proposal involves one existing seven-credit course 6651 Public Health Project/PHAR 9981 Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience - Public Health) that will be cross-listed and will meet the objectives for both programs. In addition, the required MPH courses will meet and exceed the 6 required elective credits in the PharmD program. The required PharmD courses will meet and exceed the 6 required elective credits in the MPH program.
Note that while the MPH program will be taught fully online, the PharmD program is taught face-to-face.
PharmD students who would like to complete the PharmD/MPH will apply to the MPH program as typical prospective students. Students will be expected to meet all of the current PharmD, and MPH, learning outcomes.
Program Requirements
Students enrolled in the PharmD Program at Idaho State University may combine that degree program with an MPH degree. The program is essentially the traditional PharmD program with the use of some MPH courses to meet requirements.
