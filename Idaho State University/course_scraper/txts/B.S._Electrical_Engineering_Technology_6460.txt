B.S. Electrical Engineering Technology
Program Admissions Requirements
The Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Technology (BSEET) program is a two-year program intended for graduates with an Associate of Applied Science degree offered by the ISU College of Technology, such as Energy Systems Electrical Engineering Technology, Energy Systems Industrial Cybersecurity Engineering Technology, Energy Systems Instrumentation Engineering Technology, Energy Systems Mechanical Engineering Technology, Energy Systems Nuclear Operation Technology, and Robotics and Communications Systems Engineering. Graduates of these programs may directly enter the BSEET program.
It is expected that graduates of these technology programs will have completed the following courses before entering the program: ENGL 1101, COMM 1101, MATH 1170, a course fulfilling GE Objective 6 and either PHYS 1101/PHYS 1101L or CHEM 1111/CHEM 1111L. Graduates of the BSEET program are required to complete both PHYS 1101/PHYS 1101L and CHEM 1111/CHEM 1111L in fulfillment of GE Objective 5 .
