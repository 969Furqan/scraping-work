Elective credits to total a minimum of 33 credits hours for the master’s degree must be taken from relevant graduate-level courses. Elective credits must be approved in advance by the student’s major advisor. In certain situations, a student’s program of study might exceed 33 credits. The three most common situations are:
Applicants will be evaluated as to their teaching experience with Deaf/hard of hearing children:
those with three or more years of such teaching experience will be able to waive

Teaching Internship in Deaf Education
(3 credits), but will need to take added electives;
those who do not meet the three years of teaching experience will need to take

(3 credits).
Applicants who do not meet American Sign Language proficiency will need to complete appropriate coursework; verification can be established through various sign language quality assurance examinations (e;g, RID, NAD, or EIPA [3.5 or above] certification), or transcript verification.
Applicants who do not have appropriate coursework in communication sciences/disorders and audiology will be advised to take appropriate courses in order to meet the teacher of the Deaf and hard of hearing standards as identified in state certification/licensing documents. A thorough examination of each applicant’s transcript will be completed to determine what coursework the student has completed and what coursework is needed to complete the Master of Science in Deaf Education, as well as state certification/licensure requirements to become a teacher of the Deaf/hard of hearing.
