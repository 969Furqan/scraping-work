Accelerated B.S. Biology, Biomedical Sciences Concentration
Accelerated BS to MS Program
Students accepted into an accelerated undergraduate program may take departmentally approved graduate coursework as part of their undergraduate curriculum.  These credits will count towards both their bachelor's and master's degrees and can fulfill major requirements, upper-division requirements, and/or free electives.  For details on accelerated programs at Idaho State University, please see (
Degree Requirements
).
Once accepted into an
accelerated
degree program, it is strongly recommended for students to stay in close communication with their advisor regarding pursuit of acceptance into the Graduate School and the master's degree program at Idaho State University. Acceptance into an
accelerated
program during the bachelor's degree program is the first step in the admissions process. A separate application to the Graduate School is necessary for all
accelerated
programs. For more information regarding application and admission to the Graduate School at Idaho State University, please see the Graduate Admissions section of the graduate catalog (
http://coursecat.isu.edu/graduate/graduateadmissions/
).
Biology Accelerated Criteria
This accelerated program gives outstanding bachelor’s degree students in Biology  a “fast-track” option to pursue their Master of Science in Biology degree.
Students accepted into the accelerated program may take up to 8 credit hours of 5000 level courses during the last two semesters of their bachelor’s program that will apply to both the bachelor’s and master’s degree requirements.  Students have to meet all requirements for both the bachelor’s degree and master’s degree.
Additional requirements for students in this program are:
Students need to identify a suitable advisor for their MS program (see  https://www.isu.edu/biology/degree-programs/graduate-degrees/ms-biology/).
Students must earn at least a “B” (3.0) in each graduate-level course counted for the program.
Eligibility for this program:
Completion of at least 70 undergraduate credits
applicable to the Bachelor of Science in Biology program at the time of application.
Overall GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale at the time of application.
Students who wish to enroll in this program should submit an application no later than the end of the second semester of their junior year.  Applicants are not required to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test.
Meeting these eligibility requirements does not guarantee acceptance into the accelerated master’s degree programs.
Program Admissions Requirements
There are no program admission requirements for the BS in Biology, Biomedical Sciences Concentration.
