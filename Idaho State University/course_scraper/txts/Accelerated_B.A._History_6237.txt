Accelerated B.A. History
Accelerated BA to MA Program
Students accepted into an accelerated undergraduate program may take departmentally approved graduate coursework as part of their undergraduate curriculum.  These credits will count towards both their bachelor's and master's degrees and can fulfill major requirements, upper-division requirements, and/or free electives.  For details on accelerated programs at Idaho State University, please see (
Degree Requirements
).
Once accepted into an accelerated degree program, it is strongly recommended for students to stay in close communication with their advisor regarding pursuit of acceptance into the Graduate School and the master's degree program at Idaho State University. Acceptance into an accelerated program during the bachelor's degree program is the first step in the admissions process. A separate application to the Graduate School is necessary for all accelerated programs. For more information regarding application and admission to the Graduate School at Idaho State University, please see the Graduate Admissions section of the graduate catalog (
