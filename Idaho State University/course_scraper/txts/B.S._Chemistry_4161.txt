B.S. Chemistry
A suggested sequence for taking the required science courses is given below. Students who opt for a variation from the suggested sequence should check to ensure that course prerequisites have been satisfied. Because many courses have structured prerequisites, major deviations from this schedule could increase the time required to obtain the degree.  Students pursuing this degree must complete 8 of the 9 General Education Objectives (a minimum of 36 credits - see the
General Education Requirements
described in the Academic Information section of this catalog).
Students working on a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry
should complete
ENGL 1101
or
ENGL 1101P
, and
COMM 1101
during the freshman year, and
ENGL 1102
should be passed by, or during, the sophomore year. (General Education Objective 1 is satisfied by taking
ENGL 1101
or
ENGL 1101P
, AND
ENGL 1102
. General Education Objective 2 is satisfied by
COMM 1101
.)
The mathematics requirement (Objective 3) should be fulfilled by
MATH 1170
and
MATH 1175
as early as feasible.
