International Students
Applicants whose first language is not English need to meet the following TOEFL requirements for Classified admission:
Internet-based test (iBT): a total score of 80 with a score of at least 20 on each Section (graduate assistants who teach courses must score 23 or above on the Speaking Section) on the iBT; or

Paper-based test: a total score of 550 with a score of at least 55 on Section l (Listening Comprehension) on the paper test or a score of 84 on the MTELP, or a score of 6 on the IELTS.
*Altered consideration may be given to items evaluated for admittance pending petition approval from the Ph.D. in Rehabilitation and Health Sciences
Executive Council (PhD EC)
All applicants are reviewed on a competitive case-by-case basis. Qualified applicants may be invited for an interview with members of the RHS faculty. Meeting entry-level requirements for admission does not guarantee a seat in the program. Admission into the program is separate from an offer of funding.
Preferential consideration
will be given to those applicants already holding graduate degrees / clinical certification and demonstrated academic potential in Audiology, Speech-Language Pathology, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, or other related fields. Others may apply and will be considered for admission based on merit and potential for success.
General Requirements
The Doctor of Philosophy in Rehabilitation and Health Sciences requires a minimum of 60 credits post-graduate degree or equivalent across: Academic Core, Research Core, Specialized Program, and Dissertation areas. Prior to starting the program, the applicant must have completed a bachelor’s degree; completion of a graduate degree is also preferred. If a student is accepted to and starts the program without having completed a graduate degree in Audiology, Occupation Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech-Language Pathology, or a related field, or if they are currently enrolled in a graduate program, they may be required to complete graduate-level clinical-entry didactic coursework within their primary discipline during their program (typically an additional 30 or more credit hours). These students may or may not receive specific clinical education training along with clinical placements during their program, but it may be an option if desired and if approved by the student’s advisory committee, Ph.D. EC, and Ph.D. Program Director(s).
All students and candidates must adhere to:
ISU / ISU Graduate School policies, procedures, and requirements
RHS PhD program policies, procedures, and requirements
*Failure to adhere to the policies, procedures, or requirements, poor performance/progress, or unprofessional/unethical conduct may result in probationary actions or immediate dismissal from the program.
Special Requirement (may not apply to all students)
Thesis Equivalent (1-6 credits of COH 7050)
: Students who did not complete a graduate thesis (or comparable research project) must complete a supervised research project prior to starting their research practicum. The project will follow ISU Graduate School requirements, policies, and procedures with the exception of not having to submit the final document to the graduate school for approval.
Program Requirements
The student/candidate must have a major advisor and advisory committee as defined in the RHS Ph.D. studies manual. Mutual consent from both the student/candidate and a major advisor must be obtained and maintained throughout the program of study. Following the student’s self-evaluation the major advisor and advisory committee will initially be responsible for monitoring and evaluating annual performance and progress. Student progress will also be evaluated by the Ph.D. EC and Ph.D. in RHS Program Director(s).
Curriculum Requirements
: The program of study consists of four core elements: Academic Core, Research Core, Specialized Program, and Dissertation. Students will work with their major advisor and their advisory committee to develop a program of study, which must be approved by the Ph.D. EC and Ph.D. in RHS Program Director(s). Programs of study are individualized per student therefore the courses listed below provide a sampling of potential options. Changes to the program of study, major advisor, or advisory committee members may occur and will be handled by the Ph.D. in RHS petitions process as described in the RHS Ph.D. in the manual.
Academic Core (12 credits): Academic core is focused on enhancing the student’s understanding of the related professions, interprofessionalism, and pedagogical theory and application.

Comprehensive Examinations: During the final semester of didactic coursework, or shortly following that semester, including completion of the student’s research practicum project with manuscript submission for publication consideration, the advisory committee will determine the nature of the written and oral comprehensive examinations. If the student passes their comprehensive examinations they then work with the major advisor to establish a dissertation committee and then begin the development of their dissertation project(s). If the student’s performance on the comprehensive written or oral examinations etc is unsatisfactory, the committee will determine remediation procedures, timing, and sequences for the second, final, attempt at the examination. Failure of an examination a second time will result in dismissal from the program.

Specialized Program (15 credits): Specialized program develops the student’s area of expertise and scholarship through coursework, independent studies, directed student learning, and guided research. At least 6 credits of basic or applied sciences outside of the COH must be taken and should be based on the student’s area(s) of interest and program needs. A main requirement of the Specialized Program element is the research practicum, COH 8050, where the student is mentored through a research project that results in a manuscript submitted for publication consideration to a refereed academic journal of appropriate caliber. The project must follow ISU graduate thesis guidelines, requirements, and procedures, with the following exceptions: a GFR is not required and neither is submission of the completed document to the graduate school for approval.
Research Projects: Students must successfully complete their research projects including their thesis equivalent (
when appropriate
), Mentored Research Practicum (i.e., COH 8050), and Dissertation (COH 9000 / 9001). If a student does not successfully pass their first attempt at a prospectus or defense from one of their research projects they are given one attempt to remediate. If the second attempt is failed they are immediately dismissed from the program.
Grant Submission: The student and advisor will work together to develop and submit at least one proposal for funding during the student’s / candidate’s program.
Upon successful completion of a student’s dissertation prospectus, they are recommended for doctoral candidacy to the ISU Graduate School.
*Students must complete all aspects of the program within five years of completion of their comprehensive exams per ISU Graduate School Requirements.
