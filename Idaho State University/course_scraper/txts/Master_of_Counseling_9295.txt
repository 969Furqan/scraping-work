In addition to knowledge and experience in the following eight common-core areas, graduates also have specialized knowledge and skills as identified in the objectives of the Marriage, Couple, and Family Counseling; Clinical Mental Health Counseling; Clinical Rehabilitation Counseling; School Counseling; and Student Affairs Counseling majors.

Admission Requirements
Admission into the counseling program is competitive. A preset number of students will be admitted, according to faculty resources. The Admissions Committee will make the final recommendation regarding admission based on grade point and test score rankings, as well as on the committee's impression of the applicant's interpersonal style and compatibility of personality with the program's training philosophy, and on the student's written statement.
The applicant must:
Have a bachelor’s degree from a college or university accredited in the United States, or its equivalent from a school in another country (must complete degree before onset of classes in the Fall semester in year of acceptance).
Meet the guidelines for admission set forth by the Graduate School and the Department of Counseling. Those individuals meeting both criteria will be invited for an interview. The minimum master's level standards for admission using the GPA Standardized Test (last 60 credits) are as follows:
3.0 to 4.0
: No Performance Requirements Necessary
2.5 to 2.999
: Performance Requirements Necessary (3.25 GPA after 12 credits of graduate study in the Dept of Counseling)
Below 2.499
: No Admission
The method for calculating an admission GPA is based on the last 60± semester undergraduate credits (90 ± quarter credits).
Prospective students are expected to come to campus (Pocatello or Meridian) for an interview. Selected applicants will be interviewed by the Department of Counseling Admissions Committee as part of the admissions procedure. Ultimately, one's GPA qualifies one to take part in the interview process.
Submit three (3) letters of recommendation from individuals who have knowledge of the applicant’s academic capabilities, work performance, professional potential, and character.
Apply to Graduate School and Department of Counseling by online application by January 15.
Only applicants who have submitted all application materials on or before the application deadline will have their materials reviewed by the Admissions Committee to determine status as a competitive, qualified applicant (incomplete, late, or inaccurate files/forms will not be reviewed). Due to the competition for limited seats in the Master of Counseling program, satisfactory completion of the entry-level requirements does not guarantee acceptance.
