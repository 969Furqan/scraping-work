B.A. Biology with Natural History Concentration
The B.A. in Biology with Natural History Concentration is designed for students who want to pursue a career where skills and knowledge of natural history (outdoor or environmental education, interpretation, identification, field studies) are desirable. The B.A. has fewer courses in Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics than the B.S. in Biology, and more upper division electives, providing students with greater latitude to design their own program of study. Students who pursue the B.A. in Biology
will not meet the minimum requirements
for admission to most graduate research programs in biological sciences or professional programs in the health sciences.
The B.A. degree requires that students complete all of the
General Education Objectives
described in the Academic Information section of this catalog.  Students must also satisfy the core requirements listed below and the requirements of the Natural History Concentration.  All graduates of this degree program will earn a B.A. in Biology regardless of the concentration selected.
General Education
The listing below includes program requirements that also fulfill General Education requirements.

Concentration in Natural History
Students in the B.A. in Biology program with the Concentration in Natural History should meet with an advisor to select the most appropriate courses for their interests. Students in this program may consider a Minor in another program, such as Outdoor Education (see the College of Education,
Department of Human Performance and Sport Studies
, for details) or Geology (see College of Science and Engineering,
Department of Geosciences
, for details).
In addition to completing the Required Core courses and the
General Education Requirements
, students earning a B.A. in Biology in the Natural History concentration must complete the following requirements.
