Cognate (9 credits)
Cognate courses are an opportunity for students to specialize further in a particular area of study, either in or outside the field of Instructional Design. These courses may be taken within or without the ISU Instructional Design and Technology program, but must all be approved by the student’s advisor who will submit all appropriate paperwork to the Graduate School for these courses approval.
Dissertation (10 credits)
A minimum of 10 semester credits for dissertation work is required. Please note that some students may require more than 10 semester credits in order to complete the dissertation investigation.
Points of Assessment
The Comprehensive Examination is taken after the completion of all coursework; however, the exam may be taken concurrently with the second/final practicum course. It is a significant aspect of the student's total doctoral program and provides evidence that the candidate meets advanced Instructional Design standards. A passing score on the Comprehensive Examination is required in order to continue in the program.
Dissertation and Oral Defense
Upon successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the Dissertation Committee, including the Graduate Faculty Representative (GFR), is established and the student is advanced to candidacy.
All doctoral requirements must be completed within five years of passing the Comprehensive Examination. Doctoral students must also meet appropriate residency requirements.
Upon successful completion of the Comprehensive Examination and approval of the dissertation proposal by his or her Dissertation Committee, the student is authorized to complete the dissertation in preparation for the final oral defense.
