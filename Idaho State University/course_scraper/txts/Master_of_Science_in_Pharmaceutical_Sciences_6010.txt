The M.S. program offers the student a choice of four emphasis areas: Drug Discovery, Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, and Pharmacoeconomics and Administrative Sciences.
Admission Requirements
The student must apply to and meet all criteria for admission to the Graduate School. In addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School, the student must comply with the following:
Professional degree in pharmacy or a baccalaureate degree in a related field (i.e., biology, chemistry, psychology).
GPA of not less than 3.0 for all upper-division courses (final two years). (Students with a grade point average between 2.75 and 3.0 will receive consideration for admission on a Classified (w/PR) basis.)
Official report of Graduate Record Examination Scores with a minimum combined score of 300 is required on the verbal and quantitative sections and at least 50th percentile in one of the GRE sections (verbal, quantitative, or Analytical).
Applicants must have a demonstrated proficiency in the English language. Students from countries where English is not the first language must demonstrate proficiency in the English language with a minimum score of 79 (internet‐based test) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) OR an overall band of 6.5 on the Academic Examination of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).
Three letters of recommendation from individuals familiar with the applicant's academic ability and potential for graduate study.
Applicants must provide a personal statement of interest describing their career goals and identify which area of emphasis in the graduate program the applicant intends to follow and members of the department faculty with whom the applicant would prefer to complete his/her degree. Applications without a personal statement following these guidelines will be rejected.
Meeting minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. Other factors such as research publications, other evidence of scholarly work, strong recommendations by department graduate faculty, or compatibility of the applicant's career goals with department programs may influence the Admissions Committee to recommend conditional acceptance in the event that minimum qualifications have not been met.
General Requirements
All classified graduate students must register for the appropriate graduate seminar (
PSCI 6601
) each semester in which they are registered for graduate credit. A minimum of two credits in graduate seminar (
PSCI 6601
) is required for the degree.
Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences
(Drug Discovery, Pharmaceutics, or Pharmacology Emphasis)
Admission Requirements
See General Admission Requirements above. Applications for the graduate program in Pharmaceutical Sciences are reviewed twice yearly near the end of the fall and spring semesters. Deadline for the receipt of applications is April 1 for admission in the fall semester, and October 1 for admission in the spring semester. Incomplete applications and applications received after these deadlines will not be considered.
International students should also refer to the "Admission of International Students" section of the Graduate Catalog. Students with international coursework to be considered with their applications must submit an official detailed evaluation report from an institution that is a member of the National Association of Credential Services Incorporated (NACSI).
All M.S. degrees in the Pharmaceutical Sciences graduate program are thesis-based and require the completion of an original research project.
Course Requirements
A minimum of 33 credits, including at least 6 credit hours in thesis research (
PSCI 6650
), is required by the Graduate School. For all degree applicants, at least one half of total graduate credit hours required by the student’s Graduate Program Committee must be at the 6600-level. Minimum Graduate School credit requirements may not fulfill Departmental degree requirements.
All students in the graduate program, whether seeking the Doctor of Philosophy or the Master of Science, are expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and spoken English. Students may be required to successfully complete classes in speech and in technical writing at the request of the graduate program director and the graduate faculty of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
