Accelerated A.A.S./A.S. Dental Hygiene
Accelerated
A.A.S./A.S. to M.S.
This accelerated bridge program from an entry-level dental hygiene program to a Master of Science with an emphasis in Dental Hygiene is for registered dental hygienists who have already graduated from an accredited entry-level dental hygiene program and are licensed as Registered Dental Hygienists. This program is offered 100% online. Twelve credits in this program are dual credits meaning they count for both undergraduate and graduate course work creating an accelerated path to the MS in dental hygiene. Students must be in good academic standing with the Department of Dental Hygiene and Idaho State University and have demonstrated successful completion of upper division courses in the BS Degree Completion dental hygiene program while maintaining a 3.0 GPA. Please contact the Graduate Program Director regarding acceptance into the Graduate School and the Master of Science Dental Hygiene program. Students who are accepted into the BS Degree Completion program can choose to continue their degree progression to the accelerated MS program. Once the students have completed the 5 dual credit courses (12 credits that count towards both the BS degree completion and the MS in dental hygiene degree) they will be eligible to graduate with their Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene and continue on to complete the Master of Science in Dental Hygiene.
Graduates of the MSDH program at ISU are prepared to work as educators, leaders, and administrators in academia, public health, corporate settings, alternative work settings, and in research development.
Once accepted into an accelerated degree program, it is strongly recommended for students to stay in close communication with their advisor regarding pursuit of acceptance into the Graduate School and the master's degree program at Idaho State University. Acceptance into an accelerated program during the bachelor's degree program is the first step in the admissions process. A separate application to the Graduate School is necessary for all accelerated programs. For more information regarding application and admission to the Graduate School at Idaho State University, please see the Graduate Admissions section of the graduate catalog (
