A.A.S. Industrial Controls
(1 Year
)
Description:
Industrial Controls is offered as a second AAS degree following completion of an Electrical Journeyman AAS, or an Electrical Apprenticeship AAS program and completion of all General Education requirements. Students must have completed a minimum of three years of the Electrical Apprenticeship Program towards the first AAS degree before being able to apply for the Industrial Controls program.
Students in this program can complete coursework focusing on either Instrumentation and Process Control or Motor Control and Protective Relaying.
Program Objectives:
Solve technical problems typical of those encountered in the energy systems instrumentation engineering technology discipline by using critical thinking skills, current technology, and principles of mathematics and applied science.
Work and communicate effectively in multidisciplinary teams in both industrial and academic settings.
Understand current professional issues and the need to pursue lifelong learning.
Student Outcomes:
Demonstrate safe work practices on industrial equipment.
Work and communicate effectively in a diverse team environment.
Utilize test equipment to troubleshoot and analyze electrical, electronic, and instrumentation related circuits.
Analyze
alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electronic circuits and logic fundamentals.
Create schematics to document electrical, electronic, and process control systems.
Design and troubleshoot circuits for motor controls and associated devices.
Install, troubleshoot, and maintain electrical AC and DC motors, generators, and variable frequency drives.
Install, configure, calibrate, and troubleshoot pressure, temperature, level, flow, and analytical instrumentation.
Configure, troubleshoot, and optimize Proportional-integral-Derivative (PID) control loops.
10. Use the fundamentals of pump and valve operation to troubleshoot final element issues.
11. Utilize the fundamentals of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to troubleshoot and maintain process control associated with industrial plants.
12. Design, implement, and troubleshoot Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) programs and associated Human Machine Interface (HMI) applications for industrial processes.
13. Utilize the fundamentals of networks and digital communications to troubleshoot and maintain distributed plant automation and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.
