Master of Science in Environmental Science and Management
Students entering the ENSM program are required to obtain interdisciplinary admission into the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and one other academic discipline (emphasis). Admission requirements vary between academic units, and there may be departmental requirements beyond those of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering that the student must fulfill to gain departmental admission. At least 30 credits are required for the degree, of which at least 15 must be at the 6600 level. At least 10 credits must be completed within the academic emphasis, with the remainder of the course work representing ENSM course work. No more than 9 credits may be transferred from another university, with the exception of courses from the University of Idaho, which will be accepted as resident credits. Students must have completed coursework equivalent to Idaho State University’s
MATH 1160
and Idaho State University’s
CHEM 1111
and
CHEM 1112
with grades of “C” or better. Students with prerequisite course deficiencies may be admitted as Classified with Performance Requirements with the understanding that these requirements must be satisfied prior to graduation, and such efforts may not necessarily count toward graduation. Classified with Performance Requirements (w/PR) admission into the ENSM program is the prerogative of individual departments.
Thesis and non-thesis options are available for the ENSM degree. For the thesis option, a maximum of ten thesis credits may be counted toward the degree. For the non-thesis option, a maximum of three “Special Project” credits may be counted toward the degree. These credits may apply toward the requirement of 15 credits at the 6600 level. There are program-wide and department-specific requirements for the thesis and non-thesis options, and students must create a program of study in conjunction with their advisory committee. Students will register for thesis credits or non-thesis project credits in the home department of the thesis/project advisor. Some departments’ “Special Project” courses may have a different title and/or course number.
Within the framework of the basic degree requirements, an advisory committee is chosen to work with the student to create an individualized program of study. The advisory committee consists of two faculty advisors: one from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), and one from the student’s other academic discipline (emphasis). The student’s major advisor provides direction to the student regarding all relevant aspects of the program. All courses selected for fulfillment of the  program of study must be approved by the advisory committee. The initial program of study must be submitted to the ENSM program director no later than the second semester of enrollment. Changes in the initial program of study may only be made with the approval of the student’s advisory committee. The final program of study is submitted to the Graduate School for graduation clearance in accordance with Graduate School policy.
