Accelerated B.S. Biochemistry
Accelerated BS to MS Program
Students accepted into an accelerated undergraduate program may take departmentally approved graduate coursework as part of their undergraduate curriculum.  These credits will count towards both their bachelor's and master's degrees and can fulfill major requirements, upper-division requirements, and/or free electives.  For details on accelerated programs at Idaho State University, please see (
Degree Requirements
).
Once accepted into an
accelerated
degree program, it is strongly recommended for students to stay in close communication with their advisor regarding pursuit of acceptance into the Graduate School and the master's degree program at Idaho State University. Acceptance into an
accelerated
program during the bachelor's degree program is the first step in the admissions process. A separate application to the Graduate School is necessary for all
accelerated
programs. For more information regarding application and admission to the Graduate School at Idaho State University, please see the Graduate Admissions section of the graduate catalog (
http://coursecat.isu.edu/graduate/graduateadmissions/
).
Biochemistry Accelerated Criteria
(This degree appears in the Biological Sciences and Chemistry sections of the catalog.)
Two departments - Biological Sciences and Chemistry - jointly offer the B.S. degree in Biochemistry. The curriculum is designed to prepare the student for graduate work in biochemistry and related fields, as well as for admission to medical, dental, or other health professional schools. The graduate is also prepared to go directly into research or industrial positions which require preparation only at the B.S. level.
The purpose of the B.S. in Biochemistry is to serve students who seek to develop a strong background in biochemistry and the supporting sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics. Majors also gain experience in the broad areas of biochemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, and medical and/or ecological applications of each. Majors gain experience that will prepare them to participate in research development, planning and implementation, and to be competent to carry out standard biochemical and molecular biology techniques in the laboratory. The B.S. in Biochemistry prepares students to be competitive for positions in research, graduate schools, health profession schools, and in the biotechnology industry.
Core Requirements
1
Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science must satisfy all of the General Education Objectives (a minimum of 24 credits; Objectives 3 and 5 are satisfied in the core--see the
General Education Requirements
described in the Academic Information section of this catalog). Students must also satisfy the core requirements listed below and at least
20
credits of elective courses selected from Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In order to make timely progress toward the degree, it is imperative that the student work closely with a major advisor. All graduates of this program will earn a B.S. in Biochemistry.
Including the University General Education Requirements listed elsewhere (8 of the 9 General Education Objectives, a minimum of 36 credits--s
ee the
General Education Requirements
in the Academic Information section of this catalog)
, the program of study for the Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree totals a minimum of 120 credits as follows:
