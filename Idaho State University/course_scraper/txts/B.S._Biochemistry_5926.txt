B.S. Biochemistry
(This degree appears in the Biological Sciences and Chemistry sections of the catalog.)
Two departments - Biological Sciences and Chemistry - jointly offer the B.S. degree in Biochemistry. The curriculum is designed to prepare the student for graduate work in biochemistry and related fields, as well as for admission to medical, dental, or other health professional schools. The graduate is also prepared to go directly into research or industrial positions which require preparation only at the B.S. level.
The purpose of the B.S. in Biochemistry is to serve students who seek to develop a strong background in biochemistry and the supporting sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics. Majors also gain experience in the broad areas of biochemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, and medical and/or ecological applications of each. Majors gain experience that will prepare them to participate in research development, planning and implementation, and to be competent to carry out standard biochemical and molecular biology techniques in the laboratory. The B.S. in Biochemistry prepares students to be competitive for positions in research, graduate schools, health profession schools, and in the biotechnology industry.
Core Requirements
Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science must satisfy all of the General Education Objectives (a minimum of 24 credits; Objectives 3 and 5 are satisfied in the core--see the
General Education Requirements
described in the Academic Information section of this catalog). Students must also satisfy the core requirements listed below and at least
20
credits of elective courses selected from Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In order to make timely progress toward the degree, it is imperative that the student work closely with a major advisor. All graduates of this program will earn a B.S. in Biochemistry.
