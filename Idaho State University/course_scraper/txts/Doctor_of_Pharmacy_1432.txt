Curricular Philosophy
We view the curriculum as a tool to develop professionals who assume responsibility for their own learning and who are committed to the advancement of pharmacy practice. The primary curricular goal is the development of a strong foundational knowledge in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and clinical sciences that inculcates a drug-related problem-solving process specific to pharmacy and fosters an evidenced-based approach to optimizing pharmacotherapy and patient health outcomes. We embrace diversity in innovative teaching methods through sound instructional design and encourage the integration of active learning, and multiple curricular and co-curricular opportunities for leadership and professional development. Because it is a dynamic work in progress, we continue to experiment, assess, revise, and innovate within our curriculum to graduate highly competent practitioners.
Professional Curriculum
The professional curriculum requires four years of study. The first three years are a mix of didactic/laboratory courses and practice experiences. The fourth year is comprised of 42 weeks of clinical experiences.
The Doctor of Pharmacy degree can be completed in Pocatello or Meridian, Idaho or in Anchorage, Alaska. Students may complete their fourth year at our clinical sites in Idaho (Meridian, Pocatello, Twin Falls, Coeur d’Alene), at our experiential sites in the Anchorage, Alaska region, or in Reno, Nevada.
The first professional year provides a foundation in the basic and pharmaceutical sciences that includes physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, and pharmaceutics. Other courses provide a foundation for professional development that includes topics on ethics, law, drug information, research design, patient care, and the health care system.
Courses and clinical experiences in the second and third professional years build on accrued knowledge and skills. The curriculum centers on an integrated, organ-system approach to the therapeutic management of disease. Additional courses provide insight into the human relation aspects of pharmacy, dosage form design, pharmacy management, and physical assessment. A series of case studies courses, designed to enhance the student’s knowledge base and problem-solving skills while focusing on the application of knowledge to specific patient cases, spans the first three years.
The last 42 weeks, or the fourth professional year, is devoted to full-time clinical experience in various pharmacy practice environments. Students will complete seven, six-week experiences in various areas of practice. Students will also have the option of selecting an elective in an area of interest.
Given the length of the final year of the PharmD program, students will begin practice experiences in mid-May after completing their third academic year in the professional program and will continue throughout the ensuing twelve (12) months.
Program and course-level learning outcomes can be found in the
PharmD Student Handbook
