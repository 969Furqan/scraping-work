. Create your account, pay the application fee, and start uploading the required information. For assistance call 208-282-2150 or email gradadmissions@isu.edu.
In addition, you will need the following:
A 3-5 minute video Statement of Intent spoken in the Spanish language addressing a) your experience with the language, b) your goals, and c) how this program will help you reach those goals. This should not be a scripted response, but rather an example of your ability to speak extemporaneously in the Spanish language. Alternatively, the applicant may submit a recent OPI evaluation (conducted in the past 4 years) as evidence of their speaking ability.
A Writing Sample in Spanish of at least 2.0 pages (approximately 1,000 words) that conforms to the traditional 5-paragraph essay structure. A university paper or professional report written in Spanish would be ideal. If you do not have such, then you should write a paper on a topic of your choice demonstrating command Spanish and using the aforementioned 5-paragraph structure to support a claim or thesis.
Emails of two references (non-family members). One of these references must be able to speak to the applicant's academic qualifications and the applicant’s potential as a graduate student in an online program in Spanish (Desirable qualities include passion for Hispanic language and cultures, intelligence, work ethic, prioritization and time management skills, collegiality, professionalism, and resilience.) This recommender will be contacted to submit a letter of recommendation electronically. The other reference must be able to speak to the applicant's proficiency with the Spanish language and will be asked to complete an online form to this effect.
