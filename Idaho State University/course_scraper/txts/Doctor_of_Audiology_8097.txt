General Requirements:
Students receiving the degree of Doctor of Audiology must have satisfactorily completed all courses in the curriculum and passed all clinical practicum assignments. In addition, in the spring semester of the third year, the student must pass the written comprehensive examination which is embedded in CSD 6692, Comprehensive Seminar. Within the same semester, students must pass an internal departmental oral comprehensive examination that includes defense of the doctoral project which is a part of  CSD 8810, Clinical Project. According to university regulations, no student may be granted a graduate degree who does not have a 3.0-grade point average for courses listed on the Program of Study upon completion of all academic work. The Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders will terminate the graduate program of any student who has received grades of C+ or lower in two or more departmental courses, or if the cumulative GPA falls below 2.7 in the first year of study, or 3.0 by the completion of graduate studies. If a student's graduate education is terminated for reasons of poor academic performance,  a student may reapply to a different program at Idaho State University after being dismissed from his/her current program.
Additionally, graduate students deemed by the faculty not to have made satisfactory progress in the acquisition of clinical skills may be required to enroll for further credits in clinical practicum in addition to the minimum required of all students. Students may be dismissed for failure to make satisfactory progress in clinical practicum.
