The building currently housing our Artist Blacksmith program is being sold by the owner. We are actively exploring options for a new location.
Program Highlights
In this unique program, you'll learn how to control fire and hot metal to create amazing pieces that range from small scale objects to large installations. Our faculty will teach you the process and value of well formed design and technical drawing for blacksmiths, applicable to individual and collaborative projects. From here, you will create a number of projects to augment your portfolio. Graduate with strong technical skills, expanded creative thinking, artistic integrity and an impressive portfolio.
The program is delivered in the Artist Blacksmith studio at the Peel Building, located approximately one kilometre from the main campus. The studio features eight propane forges, two coke forges, cutting and welding equipment, specialty tools and adjacent classroom space. It is large and well-ventilated with lots of personal work space including benches with height adjustable anvils at individual work stations. Under the supervision of faculty and technicians, you will have access to the coke and propane forges as well as welding, grinding and sanding stations.
While the majority of classes take place at the artist blacksmith studio, the administration offices, computer labs, the library, campus store, and regular classrooms are all located at the main Haliburton Campus building.
Equivalent to two semesters of full-time study, our intensive 15-week certificate programs provide over 600 hours of hands-on studio time. Each week you will work alongside faculty members who bring their unique perspective and expertise within the discipline to the studio. Limited enrolment ensures you have access to equipment and time to interact with faculty. You will also benefit from the guidance of experienced studio technicians and extended hours in the studio after class.

Students will have the opportunity to experiment with different hammers as they complete exercises.
History of Ornamental Ironwork
ARTS1948
Units/ Hours: 48
This course provides an introduction to the major periods and styles of ornamental ironwork from 3500 BC to modern times. It traces developments of metal as an art form in historic and contemporary forged work and focuses on the impact that individual modern blacksmiths have made. Through lectures, research and presentations, students will form an important frame of reference for recognizing and identifying the various ways in which iron has been forged and assembled.  This framework will provide students with a vocabulary with which to articulate their own interests in the development of personal goals and styles in metalwork designs.
Marketing/Portfolio Development
MKTG  53
Units/ Hours: 48
Practicing artists can choose from many different paths to advance their personal and artistic goals in artistic practice, education, presentation skills and promotion and marketing as entrepreneurs. Each student will establish their own specific focus for continuing their artist's practice.
