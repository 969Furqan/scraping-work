Program Highlights
Challenge your perception of what can be created with textiles. Learn how fabric is made, how it behaves, and how to design, construct and manipulate it. Participate in the hands-on discovery of the science and techniques of fabric dyeing and pigmentation with some of Canada’s most respected fibre artists. You’ll explore fibre science, dye and pigments, needle work, surface design, embellishments, project designs and execution. Increasingly challenging projects will help you to meet your creative potential, and courses in design, colour, drawing and textile history will round out your education.
In our dedicated fibre arts studio you will have your own space to create and investigate the many dimensions and techniques of fibre arts. The studio is fully-equipped with industrial sewing machines and irons, sergers, a spinning wheel and looms.

This course will engage the student in basic drawing techniques for the design, description and development of works in fibres and fabrics. Exercises reviewing use of the tools, materials and equipment will focus on line, proportion, light, shape, texture, pattern and motif. Students will produce samples of concept sketches, working drawings and multimedia presentation renderings. Observational drawings from a variety of natural and inanimate objects and patterns will also be introduced as a rich resource for the design of sculptural forms and surface embellishment. Students will use journals to gather research material and ideas.
Fibre Arts - Dyeing
ARTS1938
Units/ Hours: 48
In this introduction to dye application techniques, students will explore the exciting dynamics available to them through the application of colour. Resists such as applied wax and physical resists will be sampled. Specialized techniques will be reviewed through lectures and/or videos. Significant consideration will be given to the continued use of colour systems in the development of personal style through a variety of palettes.
Fibre Arts - Innovation Studio I
ARTS1941
Units/ Hours: 48
In this course, students will be invited to discover and develop a personal sense of design style, the 'feel' that sets them apart from the crowd, and gives them a sense of who they are and what they want to say. Referencing contemporary fibre artists, and using techniques and tools developed in other courses that best represent their passions and own unique approach, students will be encouraged to enjoy the risk taking in experimental design. Students will present both finished works and proposals for future projects in fibres and textiles, using journals to gather research material and concepts in the development of these personal themes and interests.
Fibre Arts - Innovation Studio II
ARTS1942
Units/ Hours: 48
This course is a continuation of FAR- Innovation Studio I, continuing to support the individual development of FAR projects in conjunction with faculty and parameters established for the studio projects.
Fibre Arts - Pigment Applications
ARTS1936
Units/ Hours: 48
In this course, students will create a sample swatch book documenting their exploration of a variety of pigment application processes for patterning the surface of fabrics. 
Employing both direct and indirect applications such as stencils, painting, block printing and screen printing, and integrating the design features in pattern and colour, a thorough foundation will be established in the use of the tools materials and techniques of fabric pigment uses.
Observational drawings from a variety of natural and human-made objects will support design exploration in the development of motifs, monoprints and repeat designs for fabric. Further experience and practice in the application of the properties of colour and how they behave within colour systems will be emphasized in these studio exercises.
Fibre Arts - Project Design
ARTS1937
Units/ Hours: 48
In this project-based course, in conjunction with the faculty, students will plan, execute and critically assess a fibre arts project engaging both two-dimensional and three-dimensional design. Students will be introduced to pattern making for three-dimensional objects, which address volume and attributes of the form of the object. They will create patterns, working drawings and working sequences to further understand the steps required to produce textile art. Time management, finishing, labelling, mounting and presentation will be addressed in ongoing in class discussions.
Fibre Arts - Sculpture
ARTS1940
Units/ Hours: 48
Integrating their learning from the program so far, students will develop functional and or sculptural fibre projects with appropriate surface enrichment that reflects their own emergent style and interests. Three-dimensional projects will be discussed in relation to the principles and elements of design, and in relation to students' personal interests through presentation of research into contemporary fibre artists' work. Using techniques such as gathering, folding, filling, layering, laminating and stitch, students will physically manipulate fibres to create a textural three- dimensional surface.
Fibre Arts - Techniques
ARTS1939
Units/ Hours: 48
In this course, students will explore a variety of techniques to enrich the surface of textiles culminating in the creation of a piece of fibre art that conveys a theme using surface embellishment and manipulation. Students will have opportunity to further discover the woven cloth as they create a more complex design.
Fibre Arts Science
ARTS 450
Units/ Hours: 48
Natural fibres have been used for comfort, protection and decoration for thousands of years, but textile technologies have continued to change, expanding in 1910 with the discovery of rayon and continuing today with micro-fibres finer than the finest silk. Course activities will examine the properties and construction of fibre objects in relation to their design, care, preservation, display and merchandising. The structures of modern textiles will be further explored through studies of such processes as the spinning of yarn to preparations for dyeing. Studio projects will focus on the understanding of structure and characteristics for selection, as well as the care and handling of fibre materials. The findings of these studies will be captured in labelled sample collections and journal entries.
Marketing/Portfolio Development
MKTG  53
Units/ Hours: 48
Practicing artists can choose from many different paths to advance their personal and artistic goals in artistic practice, education, presentation skills and promotion and marketing as entrepreneurs. Each student will establish their own specific focus for continuing their artist's practice. In class sessions will involve online research, writing, digital photography, presentation and critical discussion. Pre-course assignment work will provide the data for artist documents and digital images of their work for the development of a portfolio. Students will show their work in an established campus venue as a culmination to their certificate program experience. Certificate students who have already completed the first two semesters of the Visual and Creative Arts Diploma Program will complete this course mainly as independent review and revision of their portfolio and artists documents in collaboration with faculty.
