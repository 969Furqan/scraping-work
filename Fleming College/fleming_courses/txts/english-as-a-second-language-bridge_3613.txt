Program Highlights
Eight Levels of English Skills Development
Fleming's multi-level English language development program ensures that you learn in small groups with classmates who are at a similar level to your own. The level of entry is determined through submission of external test scores and/or Fleming's assessment test. The program is taught exclusively by TESL certified teachers. Each level focuses on progression in reading comprehension, academic writing, speaking and listening, vocabulary, and pronunciation skills.
Learning Beyond the Classroom
Regular field trips help you practice your language skills outside of the classroom in specific situations, become familiar with Canadian culture and explore the natural environment of the Kawartha region.
Private Weekly Tutoring
30 minutes with a private tutor every week will help you with any challenges. It is included in your tuition fees.
Frequent Start Dates
This program offers start dates at the beginning of each semester as well as mid-semester year-round.
Pathways To Fleming Programs
Successful completion of Level 8 will give you direct entry into most Fleming College post-secondary programs, provided you meet the program-specific academic requirements. No additional IELTS or TOEFL testing will be required.
Additional Start Dates For The Upcoming Terms
In addition to start dates at the beginning of each semester, this program also offers start dates mid-semester under program code ELB-2.

Skill Development Levels
We recommend that new students take our ELB placement test on campus. Applicants may also provide a recent IELTS, TOEFL or Duolingo score upon admission and be placed directly into an ELB level. For maximum learning, students will be placed in the ELB level that corresponds to their lowest individual skill score or, where appropriate, according to the level the program believes is most suitable, regardless of IELTS, TOEFL or Duolingo results.
