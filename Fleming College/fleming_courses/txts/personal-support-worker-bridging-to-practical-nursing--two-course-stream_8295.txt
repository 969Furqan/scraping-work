Program Highlights
Fleming College offers a bridging opportunity for practicing Personal Support Workers (PSW) who have graduated from a PSW program at a private or community college, to pursue the full-time Practical Nursing diploma at Fleming College (not transferable to the Practical Nursing Programs of other Ontario Colleges.
In this stream of the part-time Bridging program, you will take two courses per semester and can complete the full program in one year. A
1-course-per-semester stream
is also available. All courses are online except the final 7-hour Field Preparation course, which is held at the Sutherland Campus in Peterborough. Eligible students who successfully complete their program can apply for direct entry into the second semester of the full-time Fleming College Practical Nursing program.
Please note that while the bridge will be offered on a part time basis, Bridging students are only eligible to apply to the full-time program located at the Sutherland campus in Peterborough. Completion of the Bridging Program does not guarantee entrance into the Practical Nursing Program. There will be a minimum of one semester between your completion of the bridging program and consideration of your application into the second semester of the Practical Nursing Program.
Bridged Nursing Theory (NRSG250) must be taken in the first semester you are enrolled in the program.
Bridge PSW to PN: Field Preparation for PSW Bridging to PN (NRSG193) must be taken last.
Why Choose Fleming

Fleming College is a community based learning environment with the first long-term care faculty (St. Joseph's at Fleming) built on a college or university campus.
Admission Requirements

Career Opportunities
