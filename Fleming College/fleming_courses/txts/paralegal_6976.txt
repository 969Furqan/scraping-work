Program Highlights
As a licensed paralegal in Ontario you can commission documents and represent clients dealing with lawsuits falling within the jurisdiction of Small Claims Court. You can act for people facing summary conviction charges under municipal by-laws, provincial statutes or the Criminal Code. Some serve as by-law enforcement personnel, or act in a prosecutorial capacity for municipal governments. Paralegals are also trained to assist clients through the potentially complex proceedings of tribunals such as the Landlord and Tenant Board, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, or the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal. Some paralegals choose to work under the supervision of lawyers or other paralegals, while others offer their services directly to the public.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
Work Experience
The 240-hour unpaid field placement is an opportunity to get an understanding of the demands and rewards of this career. Field Placement is completed during the final 15 week semester of the program. Placement opportunities must be within scope of practice as provided by the LSO. In some cases a clear criminal record check may be required by the placement employer.
Licensing Requirements
This program is accredited with the Law Society of Ontario (LSO ), the governing body for paralegals. The courses meet all competency requirements and prepare you to write the licensing exam and become a member of the LSO. Please refer to the
Law Society web site
for licensing requirements. All applicants must have graduated from an accredited program, pass the licensing exam and be of good character.
Is this You?
A desire to help people, to interpret the legal system for them, and make fair representation on their behalf is important if you want to be successful and satisfied with your Paralegal career. You should also possess:
an entrepreneurial attitude
confidence to act as an advocate for others
strong oral and written communication skills
ability to read and analyze complex legal materials
determination to conduct intricate research
strong time management skills and organizational ability
high standard of ethics
good stress management skills
If you are up to these challenges, this may be a career path worth considering. The work can be varied, stimulating and financially rewarding.
Career Opportunities
Career opportunities such as this are growing in the legal system and include employment with:
government agencies
legal clinics
administrative tribunals
law / paralegal firms
Sample job titles include: Paralegal, Administrative Tribunals Agent or Court and Tribunal Agent. After some experience in the legal field, you may decide to work on a self-employed basis, and start up your own business offering services in permitted areas of legal representation -- for example, as an agent at Small Claims Court and at some administrative tribunals, or providing legal services for residential tenancy matters.
Additional Costs
Plan to spend approximately $740 per year for books and supplies.
Indigenous Perspectives Designation
The Indigenous Perspectives Designation (IPD) is an option available to students in this program. To qualify for an IPD, you must take and successfully complete a series of required Indigenous Studies courses as well as participate in a minimum of four approved co-curricular Indigenous events or experiences. Your transcript will indicate the IPD upon graduation, a designation that provides you with a comprehensive understanding of Indigenous cultures, histories, traditions, and contributions to our shared society within the context of your program of study. The IPD provides a valuable skill set sought after in today's employment sector.
