Program Highlights
With its unique blend of evening and weekend courses as well as online and in-person delivery, professionals can continue to work in their chosen career while attending the program. Classes are scheduled for two evenings a week and one or two weekends each semester. Please contact the program coordinator for more information on class schedules.
This two-semester graduate certificate course is designed for those with professional and educational backgrounds in helping professions or in public safety who want to enhance their knowledge and skills in addiction and mental health.
Focusing on the ways that communities can collaborate using interprofessional approaches to addictions and mental health, you will discover how different professions can work together to provide outstanding public services. You will learn about responsive, culturally relevant, client-centred strategies and interventions that support individuals, groups, youth and families. You will have opportunities to apply your learning, specifically how to effectively collaborate and transform lives as a valuable part of a professional support community.
A strong emphasis in this program is placed on developing an understanding of diverse populations and the skills required to tailor strategies to their needs. You will practice the skills to enhance cultural safety in your support of clients by considering their unique and diverse social, ethnic, religious, racial, spiritual and cultural characteristics. You will also learn the intricacies of working with exceptional populations within the mental health and addictions field, developing tools and strategies for individuals with neurocognitive and developmental disorders.
Why choose Fleming?
With your background in the helping professions or public safety, you can add this specialization in just 2 semesters. The unique delivery of this program will allow working professionals to continue in their career while completing their graduate certificate.
Fleming is one of the only programs to offer interprofessional skills training in both addictions and mental health.
The program has strong connections working with community partners in both the helping professions and public safety, which is reflected in the content of the curriculum and practical experiences. You will benefit from the real-world, current practices that are integrated into the curriculum and have a broader selection for the focus of your placement in the final semester.
Program Delivery
This program is specifically designed for working professionals. Courses will include a combination of evening courses and select weekends each semester with both in-person and online synchronous learning components.
Additional Costs
The recommended résumé boosters of Non-Violent Crisis Intervention (NCVI) and Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (A.S.I.S.T.) can be taken through Fleming’s Continuing Education during your studies.
Non Academic Requirements
Your program has mandatory requirements which may include a criminal reference check, first aid, CPR-C, etc. For more information, please see the
Non Academic Requirements
page.
Practical Experience
In the final semester, you will integrate theory with practice. Through collaborative learning in Fleming’s simulation spaces and through case studies, students will practice addressing professional issues and ethical dilemmas all through the lens of client-centred care.
A concurrent seven-week, part-time field placement with a community agency or in a clinical setting will allow you to integrate and practice mental health and addictions theory and treatment strategies. Emphasis will be placed on using harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented practice, trauma-informed interventions, and effective case management. Alternatively, students may choose to do an applied project instead of a placement. Working professionals already employed in sector-related work may wish to consider an applied project that supports their existing employment.
Learning Outcomes

Provide non-biased, culturally relevant mental health and addiction interventions to make services more accessible for under-represented populations.
Assess care needs using a variety of approaches including indigenous perspectives to develop evidence-based recovery plans.
