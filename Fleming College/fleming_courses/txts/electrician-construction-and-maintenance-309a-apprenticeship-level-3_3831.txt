Electrician - Construction and Maintenance (309A) Apprenticeship - Level 3
Electrician - Construction and Maintenance (309A) Apprenticeship - Level 3
Today's electricians work with cutting edge technology such as programmable logic controls (PLC), sophisticated fire alarm systems, robotics, and assisting in setting up "smart house" systems--where everything in a house can be programmed for the needs of the homeowner. Electricians play a critical role, providing access to electricity for homeowners, businesses, and industries.
