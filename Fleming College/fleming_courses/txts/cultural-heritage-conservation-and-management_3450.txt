Program Highlights
The fundamental role of the conservation professional is to preserve and conserve, as appropriate, cultural property for present and future generations. We have a lot to learn from the experiences and events of people who have gone before us. However, we can't learn much from the past if we don't have records of it. Imagine how much history is lost to us when an ancient artifact is destroyed by perfectly well-meaning people who want to save it.
This two-year Ontario College graduate certificate is an intensive, fast-paced learning experience that you will undertake in four consecutive semesters. You'll start your classes in September and spend your first three semesters, during the fall, winter and summer, at the college. Following your introduction to the field of conservation, you will gain valuable, applied and skills-based experience in the care and handling of most common museum materials, including ceramics, glass, stone, metals, wooden objects, leather and proteinaceous materials, textiles, works of art on paper, books, archival materials, photographs and modern materials. Updated curriculum reflects a focus on hands-on skills, experienced based learning, practical applications, beyond best practices and professional standards rooted in ethical applications. Once you've learned the theory and practical skills, you'll treat museum artifacts from local, regional, and national sites. Complementary courses, workshops, assignments, and community-based projects will offer off campus opportunities to practice conservation methods. A full-time, unpaid, curriculum-based internship in your final semester (September to December) provides an invaluable learning and work experience.
Please note:
This program is extremely time-intensive, including class time, lab time, demonstrations and simulations, site visits, twilight classes, working in situ on applied projects and working in teams. Students who are able to fully commit their time enjoy the most success, and benefit greatly from the program's authentic learning experience and assessments.
Success Stories
The program has highly skilled and friendly instructors, who gave me a thorough and comprehensive education in the care and conservation of key material types. I had great opportunities to network and work on projects in the field , and that proved to be a great asset once I was looking for employment.
Rachel Nordstrom, Program Graduate - Photographic Collection Manager, Department of Special Collections, University of St. Andrews
Sometimes choosing the right College program can be a daunting task, you want to ensure that you are provided with knowledge and know-how, but also something special that makes you stand out. Choosing the Conservation Program at Fleming College did just that and it was one of the best decisions I ever made!
Tracy Satin, Program Graduate -Director/Curator, Greater Vernon Museum and Archives
The program contributed to getting me here by providing me with the training, skill set and experience (internship) necessary to work in this position. It wasn’t a straight path but an interesting one, and one that I hope continues ahead
Anne Macdonnell, Program Graduate - Paper and Textiles Conservator, Canadian War Museum
As a museum manager, I have found interns and graduates from the Fleming Museum Management and Curatorship and Cultural Heritage Conservation and Management programs to be motivated, skilled and committed to a career in the heritage sector. Following a recent nationwide search for an Assistant Curator/Collections Coordinator, our top two choices out of more than 250 applicants were both Fleming grads.

Good stewardship requires the proper care and management of cultural resources and the information associated with them.  Taken together, these actions ensure the effective preservation and documentation of, and access to, our tangible and intangible cultural heritage.   

This course consolidates and builds on knowledge and skills acquired during the preceding two semesters related to the conservation and management of cultural heritage collections.

Through presentations from `experts', site visits, and focused research, students will examine best practices associated with caring for and managing specialized types of collections, learn more about their physical and information / records management needs, identify related issues and opportunities, and gain insights into how theory intersects with practice in the field.

Importantly, in addition to the tangible objects traditionally collected by museums and galleries, this course will explore standards and practices for managing cultural resources such as Intangible and Built Heritage.

Internship and Career Orientation
MUSM  23
Units/ Hours: 30
The internship is a key opportunity to synthesize theory and practice in an approved conservation laboratory, museum or related setting under the direction of an experienced practitioner. In order to plan for an effective placement, students will complete an assessment of personal needs and resources, update resumes, initiate a search and selection process, negotiate and draft a learning contract and work plan and examine research methods for the project to be completed during the internship. In preparation for exit from the program, job search skills, contract work and human resource issues in the museum sector will also be reviewed. The course will be delivered as a combination of group workshops and one-on-one sessions.
Lab Methods III
SCIE  40
Units/ Hours: 30
This course provides an introduction to the materials, techniques, applications, and methods available for the treatment, stabilization, and care of textile, paper, parchment, and vellum artifacts.  The identification, treatment, and stabilization of decorative surfaces, including colourants, pigments and applied finishes, are also examined.  Accurate condition assessment skills will be emphasized.  Relevant theoretical laboratory knowledge and skills will be developed.

This course is predominantly applied laboratory work.  The focus will be on the identification and assessment of materials, cleaning methods: basic treatments: repair techniques and storage and display methods for textiles and works of art on paper.  Emphasis is placed on the written, drawn and photographic documentation of objects.  Conservation skills are developed through the mastery of theoretical and practical laboratory work.  NOTE:  Students wishing to pursue a specialization in textile conservation should be prepared to develop additional sewing skills.

The conservation challenges of library and archival holdings are compounded by the nature of the institutions in which they are housed and the provision of public access for research and study. The philosophy of archival and library preservation will be assessed (preservation of information versus the object) as well as integrated approaches to preventive conservation and the increasing use of new technologies and the resulting challenges. Building on the knowledge and skill base developed in the Conservation and Material Science of Paper, this applied course includes off-site visits to, and assessment of, library and archival collections.

Delivery: Placement
Field Placement
MUSM  21
Units/ Hours: 600
The internship provides the opportunity for students to observe and experience, at first hand, the operations and activities of a conservation practice and preservation management in the public or private sectors.  The fifteen week full time block placement is designed to integrate theory and practice as well as introduce new techniques, methods, approaches and equipment beyond the scope of the Fleming program.  The internship can be developed as a specialized and focused learning opportunity or a more general placement in preventive conservation and preservation management.  Projects are planned and directed with faculty support and implemented under the supervision of a qualified practising conservator or preservation manager.Please Note:  Full tuition fees apply and students must be registered with the college before starting their internship.  Internships are not paid.
