Program Highlights
Animal conservation biology has grown in recent years with the global loss of species diversity due to several factors, including habitat destruction, disease, and climate change. The Conservation Biology program will help address this – it is the only diploma program in Ontario that focuses solely on applied skills and research in animal biodiversity conservation.
As part of the program, you will:
Develop a broad background in animal biodiversity conservation
Take part in field work and lab work specific to conserving animal populations
Carry out genetic and tissue sampling with a focus on eDNA
Develop skills and knowledge in identifying at-risk aquatic and terrestrial animals, and assess their risk factors
Perform field surveys, and complete an applied research project in semester 4
Why Choose Fleming
Fleming College has more grads working in the environmental and natural resources sectors than any other college in Canada. We have an established reputation in the field. Our dedicated and knowledgeable faculty will guide you on your academic journey as you take advantage of our exceptional learning spaces – indoors and outside. A common first semester, shared with the other diploma programs in our School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, provides you with a solid foundation before you go on to specialize in your area of study.

or contact your program coordinator for more information.
Experiential Learning
In addition to the field work and labs within your courses, the program includes a 40-hour field camp in semester 3. In semester 4, you will undertake a semester-long applied research project, which will give you real-world work experience.
Common First Semester
Students in our School’s diploma programs take the same courses for first semester. This common focus exposes you to a variety of career options and other programs. You will have the freedom to explore and obtain a multidisciplinary perspective, while you acquire a base of knowledge and fundamental skills. Although students are accepted into a specific program for their first semester, the common first semester allows you to change direction if you find another program or career area is more appealing. Once you have successfully completed the common first semester, you can enter the program of your choice in second semester, subject to enrolment capacity.
