Program Highlights
Statistics continue to confirm that those getting into this skilled trade now will likely have steady employment for as long as they want to work in the welding and fabricating sector. In this program, you will learn how to:
Select and apply welding processes and troubleshoot welding equipment
Use a variety of destructive and non-destructive methods to test welds and acquire advanced skills in fitting and fabrication
Gain comprehensive theoretical knowledge and have extensive practical hands-on training in welding and metal cutting techniques and all major welding processes
Welding Certifications
This program provides progressive opportunities to earn Canadian Welding Bureau (CWB) certifications. The program curriculum aligns with having completed Level III of the in-school portion of the Welding Apprenticeship:
Upon successful completion of the two-semester Welding Techniques Certificate you will have the opportunity to test for the 1GF (Flat fillet and groove welds) and 2GF (horizontal position) certification from CWB
Once you have successfully completed 2 more semesters in the Welding Fabrication Technician program, you will have the opportunity to test for the 3GF and 4GF (vertical and overhead positions)
The program focuses on a variety of techniques and accompanying theory associated with welding ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Courses include:
