Program Highlights
Building Leaders... Building Inclusion
The Developmental Services Worker program focuses on providing support to people with various intellectual disabilities, such as Down Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Traumatic Brain Injury and neurocognitive disorders, learning disabilities and/or physical disabilities. Graduates have the knowledge, skills and attitudes that include - and exceed - compassionate caring to support the empowerment of people with disabilities, while providing leadership in promoting social inclusion and helping people accomplish their goals and reach their dreams. Students in this program also develop an understanding of the past, present and future of developmental services in Ontario and how it impacts the current lives of individuals and families.
This two–year Ontario College diploma program is designed to provide the specialized skills required for professionals who make a difference every day in the lives of children, youth and adults who have disabilities as well as their support network at home, and in the community, (school, recreation, mental health and addictions, justice supports, employment support and more). Students also learn a variety of alternative communication options to support the needs of the people they work with. Developmental Services Workers maintain and promote their professional values such as social justice, empowerment, dignity, self-worth, the importance of healthy human relationships, and integrity.
Students begin to specialize in person-centered, strength-based assessments and develop strategies for individuals, their families, and community inclusion through various community-based projects and field placements. Curriculum and field placements align with and exceed provincial and industry standards for the developmental services sector.
