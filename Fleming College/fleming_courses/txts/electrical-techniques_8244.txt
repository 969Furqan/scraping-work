Semester 1
Delivery: In Person
Communications I for Trades and Technology Professionals
COMM 254
Units/ Hours: 45
Communications 1 for Trades & Technology is an introductory course that provides a foundation in college-level communications. In this course, students learn to read critically, write appropriately for a variety of audiences, conduct research, cite references, revise for clarity and correctness, and present those results in various formats. In seminars, labs, and modules students will engage in both independent and collaborative activities relevant to Trades & Technology fields, including the development and presentation of a research assignment to help them become more effective communicators in academic and professional contexts.
Drawings, Standards and Specifications Fundamentals
ELCT 144
Units/ Hours: 45
Upon successful completion, the apprentice is able to interpret and use information provided from drawings, specifications and standards for electrical installation and maintenance (single-phase). The apprentice is also able to create drawings and schedules.
Electrical Fundamentals
ELCT 184
Units/ Hours: 105
Upon successful completion, the student is able to apply electrical principles, concepts and associated calculations as well as demonstrate the following; how to measure circuit parameters, how to build series, parallel and combination circuits and the relationship between work, power and energy.
Electrical Installation Practices
ELCT 107
Units/ Hours: 75
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to demonstrate the safe operation of common hand and power tools AND to use those tools to install common switching devices, outlets and enclosures while correctly terminating conductors in a residential construction setting. The learner will further be able to demonstrate the installation procedures for non-metallic sheathed cable, armoured cable, LVT, CAT5, RG6, rigid and flexible raceway installation methods. Furthermore, the learner will be introduced to the basic across-the-line motor starter, low-voltage release and low-voltage protection.

This course also serves to introduce network cabling concepts, trade safety, codes/standards and installation methods. In this course, the student will gain the knowledge and skills to safely and effectively install, operate and maintain building electronic systems. These systems include structured cabling, AV, telecommunications, network and security wiring in residential buildings.
Health and Safety Theory Applications
CNST 159
