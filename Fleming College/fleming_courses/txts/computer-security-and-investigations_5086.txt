Program Highlights
The Computer Security and Investigations program is designed to provide you with the necessary knowledge and skills to take a leadership role in the protection and security of information technology. Your classes are regularly reviewed and improved to be the most current subjects demanded by the industry, such as:
Advanced Ethical Hacking
Incident Response
Vulnerability, Threat and Risk Analysis
Information Security
Advanced Computer Forensics
Internet and Hacking Investigations
Open Source Intelligence
CISCO Network Design and Management
Network Security
In addition to these cutting-edge subjects, you will also learn how to assess technical risk, develop systems and processes, to manage the risks associated with information technology, and be capable of providing technical assistance to prevent, investigate, and protect individuals and organizations from cyber-crime. Your studies will be from a security management and hands on technical perspective, with emphasis placed on the skills required to implement information technology security, and the investigative skills necessary to respond appropriately to breaches of security.
You will have the added benefit of courses in law and justice, taking advantage of Fleming College's reputation and experience in these fields, in addition to obtaining the technical training you need to function as a cyber security consultant. In this three-year program, the final sixth semester is an applied project or field placement in partnership with business and, industry, or government department.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
