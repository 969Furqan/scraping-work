Application Process
Students interested in the Mental Health and Addictions Worker / Social Service Worker Dual Diploma program are required to enter via the
Mental Health and Addictions Worker
program. During the first semester, students can apply, through an internal application process, to be considered for entry to the dual diploma stream
Program highlights
This dual-diploma pathway is only available to students who start their program in the fall or the winter. After a common first semester, students in the Mental Health and Addiction Worker program and Social Service Worker program can declare their intention to complete both programs.
By choosing this Dual Diploma pathway as a Mental Health and Addiction Worker student, you will gain complementary competencies in the field of Social Service to work in a broader context with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities to respond to social issues, injustices and inequalities through counselling, community services and social support programs. This program is infused with practical learning experiences and prepares graduates to work in a range of residential and community settings with other professionals such as child and youth workers, teachers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors. The curriculum will also build knowledge and skills in traditional healing practices and understanding of intergenerational trauma impact of colonization and assimilation policies.
As Social Service Worker is a regulated profession in Ontario, graduates of this dual diploma pathway will have the necessary skills for employment as a Social Service Worker in Ontario and will be eligible for membership through the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Services. Please see the
OCSWSSW website for more information
about the profession and eligibility for membership.
Field Placement
Students who start in the Mental Health and Addiction Worker program will complete their Social Service Worker field placement in the fifth semester and their Mental Health and Addiction Worker field placement in the sixth and final semester, consolidating the practical and theoretical knowledge gained in the classroom during their program. You will be expected to complete one field placement with an emphasis upon social service practice and one that focuses on mental health and addiction.
30 hours of volunteer service within an agency are required prior to entry into the fifth semester for the Social Service Worker (SW) placement and you must have successfully completed all courses prior to entry into fifth semester.
Specific agencies may have requirements such as proof of a current Emergency First Aid certification, CPR certification (Level C), a university degree, or additional immunizations. Note that some agencies may require in-service training that you must take prior to placement.
Why Choose Fleming
Fleming College is one of the few colleges in Canada to offer a dual diploma pathway in Mental Health and Addiction Work and Social Service Work.

In addition, both programs are well-known within the Peterborough, City of Kawartha Lakes, Northumberland, and Haliburton counties and have established strong relationships with agencies in these specific locations. With a dual diploma, you will graduate with a broader skill set and have wider career choices.
Career Opportunities
When you choose the Dual Diploma pathway, you are creating opportunities to advance your profession and expand your prospects.
There is a high demand for mental health and addiction professionals. Roles include case manager, mental health clinician, addiction counsellor, or relief staff in residential facilities or community withdrawal management services, health promotion and outreach services.  In addition, as a practicing Social Service Worker in Ontario, you will support people to recognize, develop and sustain their strengths to achieve good quality of life while they manage and challenge a broad range of personal and environmental barriers at the personal, cultural, and system levels.
