Program Highlights
As a Paramedic, you will respond to medical, traumatic and a whole variety of other types of calls in addition to ongoing medical education and base duties. Paramedics are typically dynamic, fun-loving individuals who love challenges and change.
This program will prepare you for the challenges and rewards of this exciting career. You will be trained in all aspects of pre-hospital emergency care, including the knowledge and skills to deal effectively with medical emergencies and traumas, and the ability to communicate effectively with patients, other emergency responders and other members of the medical community. Your training will be delivered in classroom, laboratory, clinical, and field practice settings, so that you will acquire the optimum combination of theory and practical skills. This program has been created with the assistance and advice of paramedic professionals and associations, and as such, will provide you with the essentials you need to provide health care in the midst of a crisis.
Why Choose Fleming
Fleming College has a strong reputation for providing excellent training in health care. Fleming's program focuses on two goals: graduates passing the provincial Advanced Emergency medical Care (AEMCA) exam, plus getting you comfortable and competent in your new skill set. We have many part-time, active paramedics as faculty who will guide and assist you to these goals. Our equipment is top of the line and helps in the simulation of real life scenarios.
Work Experience
During the second year you will have the opportunity to experience the real-life world of the paramedic - 420 hours of consolidation/preceptorship, working in the field with paramedics. There will also be 30 hours of ambulance operations and hands-on driving during the first semester to provide you with experience handling a large vehicle. Clinical placements aid in allowing patient exposure in a controlled environment with an instructor.
Is this You?
In order to succeed in this program, and in your eventual career as a paramedic, you will need the following skills, abilities, and personality traits:
enjoy working with and helping people
excellent crisis management skills
excellent communication skills
strong leadership ability
ability to multi-task
compassion, empathy, integrity, honesty
excellent time management/prioritization skills
willingness/ability to work as part of a team
excellent physical health, strength and stamina
well-developed stress management skills
excellent problem-solving ability
Students would benefit by having basic computer skills including e-mail, word processing, file management and internet web browsing. Prospective students should be aware that the pass rate for Fleming's Paramedic program, as for most Paramedic programs, is 70% in core courses, which reflects and prepares students for the minimum pass rate required for the provincial AEMCA exam.
Career Opportunities
As a graduate of this program, you will be qualified as a primary care paramedic and will be eligible to write the provincial examination. Upon successful completion, you will be certified by the province as an Advanced Emergency Medical Care Assistant - AEMCA. Once you complete the program and the provincial paramedic exams, you will be eligible to work as a primary care paramedic in ambulance services throughout Ontario. Once working as a primary care paramedic, you can then upgrade your skills to work as an advanced care or critical care paramedic. You may also find employment in health and safety, or rescue services. This diploma is also an asset to anyone seeking employment as a firefighter or police officer. This is especially relevant in situations where paramedic/emergency medical care might not be available, such as in remote areas.
Students are advised to try to obtain their class F licence as soon as possible as an F licence is required for job applications in early fourth semester.
Students should also be advised that eligibility for employment is subject to the requirements of the Ambulance Act, which includes a valid Ontario class F licence, a criminal reference check, and physical fitness, as lifting is a major component of the job.

Additional Costs
Plan on $1,500 per year for books, supplies and materials.
Physical Requirements
Physical requirements include being able to lift, with a partner, a patient weighing 210 lbs in a variety of ways.
Lifts include on a backboard from the ground, in a chair up and down two flights of stairs and on the stretcher in and out of the ambulance.
These are very difficult lifts requiring strength, stamina and coordination. A good way to test your current abilities is to try lifting alone, 80 -100 lbs from the floor (using your legs and keeping your back straight) and then going up and down 2 flights of stairs frontwards and backwards (105 lbs alone simulates 210 lbs with two people).
There is no lift testing for admission into the program, but you must meet the 210 lbs standard by the end of the first year.
Non Academic Requirements
Your program has mandatory requirements which may include a criminal reference check, first aid, BLS-HCP for CPR, etc. For more information, please see the
Non Academic Requirements
page.
Failure to provide any of the required Non Academic Field Requirements by the specified due date will result in an inability to participate in the mandatory placement components of the program.
