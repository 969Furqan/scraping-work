Program Highlights
Work with some of Canada's finest jewellery artists to develop the skills and techniques to showcase your artistic vision. Starting with a chain of your own design, you'll continue with increasingly complex work in making models, fabrication, forming, stone setting and surface decoration. You will explore both traditional and modern techniques with a variety of materials as you learn a general overview of the industry. This program provides essential skills that can be honed upon graduation to support a career in Jewellery.
The studio is well-furnished with a full complement of tools and anvils, eight individual soldering stations, and all the equipment you'll need for silversmithing, casting, raising, stone setting and chain making. You'll have your own jeweller's workbench equipped with a bench pin, task lighting and a foredom drill press. The overall studio space is bright and spacious for 16 students, which is the maximum number accepted into the program.
Equivalent to two semesters of full-time study, our intensive 15-week certificate programs provide over 600 hours of hands-on studio time. Each week you will work alongside a different faculty member who brings their unique perspective and expertise within the discipline to the studio. Limited enrolment ensures you have access to equipment and time to interact with faculty. You will also benefit from the guidance of experienced studio technicians and extended hours in the studio after class.
