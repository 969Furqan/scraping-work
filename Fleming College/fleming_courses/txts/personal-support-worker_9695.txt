Program Highlights
As a graduate of the Personal Support Worker program, you will provide support services to individuals and families in need of assistance. With this satisfying, people-focused career, you will be prepared to assist children, adults, and seniors with special needs or disabilities, and help them maximize their life experience. You can start the program in September or January or May.
This two-semester Personal Support Worker program may particularly appeal to those re-entering the workforce. In total, you'll get approximately 400 hours of relevant theory and approximately 300 hours of real-life, clinical training. The focus of this program is on:
lab components throughout both semesters
hands-on, task-oriented skills and practice time
course content related to long term care and to community care to diversify your experience
innovative new lab facilities that simulate the work environment
more theory related to practice
The clinical placement agency will request that you submit a current police records check, including vulnerable sector. Applicants who have been convicted of an offense under the criminal code for which they have not been pardoned may be denied the opportunity to enter clinical placement.
Why Choose Fleming
The College ensures the program follows ministry guidelines, and as such, the program is widely recognized by agencies and related employers. There's a consistently high, over 90 per cent employment rate for graduates of this program -- you might be hired before you finish the course.
The course load, teachers and curriculum exceeded my expectations. I was challenged by some of the curriculum, which I greatly enjoyed. I also felt like I belonged. I completed 180 placement hours, and it was as if my textbook was coming to life. The placements were absolutely educational and equipped us for the actual job.
Lindsay Barr, Program Graduate
