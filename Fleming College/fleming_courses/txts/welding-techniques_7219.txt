Program Highlights
This program provides you with entry level employable skills for the welding field. Curriculum in the program has been aligned to the basic requirements for Level One Apprenticeship for Welding Fabrication.
Labour market demand for skilled welders is high -- this program will introduce you to numerous welding processes and you will gain extensive hands-on experience on the most common processes used within the industry. These processes include:
SMAW (shielded metal arc welding)
GMAW (gas metal arc welding)
You will also be exposed to specialized processes such as:
FCAW (flux core arc welding)
GTAW (gas tungsten arc welding)
Basic blueprint reading, trade math, weld symbols, metallurgy, oxy-fuel and plasma cutting/gouging will also be covered. Upon successful completion of the Welding Techniques program, you will be given the opportunity to challenge the SMAW 1G weld test and the 2GF certification from Canadian Welding Bureau. If successful, you will be issued a Welding Ticket by CWB which is valid for two years.
You will also have Grade 12 Math equivalency.
In addition, you will have an opportunity to obtain industry related health and safety certifications.
Want to add more specialized skills in welding? You can use this program to pathway into semester 3 of the
Welding and Fabrication Technician
diploma program.
Success Story
I was hired on as a welder at Rockwerx Canada Inc. a couple of weeks after finishing the Welding Techniques program. The company builds rock climbing walls, and I do everything from shipping, HR, accounting and general operations at the office, to various aspects of on-site construction. I wear many hats, and because I don’t have a specific job title, my business card says “boss like.” I decided to take the Welding Techniques program because, when I was about to graduate with my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, I realized that jobs in my field weren’t exactly plentiful or well-paid. So, I wanted to have a trade to fall back on. I had done some welding while doing metal sculptures for my degree, and I really liked it. I’m so glad I entered the trades because I love my job, I’ve been able to travel to some amazing places (such as Qatar), and when I wake up in the morning, I’m stoked to go to work.
