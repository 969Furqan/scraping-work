Program Highlights
In this 12-week program you will learn about the operation and preventative maintenance of heavy construction equipment. The Heavy Equipment Operator program is all about hands-on learning. You'll develop the skills you need using bulldozers, rubber-tired loaders, tractor loader backhoes, hydraulic excavators, rock trucks, skid steers and various other construction site equipment. What you will learn in the classroom will focus on the essentials to help you master your operating skills. Courses include personal, work site and equipment safety, earthmoving technology, equipment maintenance, and heavy equipment operating techniques.
Are You an Employer?
Funding to train your employees may be available through the
Canada-Ontario Job Grant
. Train your employees at one-third of the cost.
Success Stories
I grew up around heavy equipment and I've always been interested in it. My Dad is in the construction business and he suggested I take the Heavy Equipment Operator program. I'm glad I did. I learned a lot and the focus on worksite and equipment safety really made me aware of how important it is to work safely. When I graduated, I was hired by Fleming College to work in the program in a support role, doing simulator training and assisting with field operations.
Evan Fudge, Heavy Equipment Operator graduate from Cambray (City of Kawartha Lakes), Ontario.
