Throughout this program you can expect to:
Learn the role and legislative jurisdiction of Customs, Immigration and other Government departments
Apply enforcement techniques and procedures for the cross-border movement of people and goods
Learn how to complete and scrutinize cross-border documentation relating to duties, taxes, transportation, and other government departments

Develop dispute resolution, critical thinking skills and communications that are in demand for both private and public sectors of customs/border services in Canada
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
