Program Highlights
With a career in the field of biotechnology, students have diverse employment opportunities in a variety of areas including research, quality assurance and control, medical or health-related fields, DNA extraction and analysis. Laboratory related occupations are among the fastest growing occupations in the economy. With a unique combination of courses, our biotechnology program graduates are in demand across a variety of fields. This advanced diploma program would traditionally take six semesters to complete. However, the program has been designed in an accelerated, compressed format, to provide six semesters of course work over five semesters.
Courses taking place in Semesters 1-4 in the program integrate theory and practice opportunities in labs and experiential learning. This prepares students for their final, fifth semester, where they must complete their placement (this can occur from May-August, September-December, or January-April). Resulting graduates will be critical thinkers with problem-solving abilities, strong interpersonal, teamwork and communication skills and a solid, hands-on skillset in a lab setting.
Why Choose Fleming
This cross-disciplinary program combines elements from the life sciences, quality control and assurance through ISO17025 regulations, data management, forensic science, automation, and professional skills. This gives graduates the benefit of having multiple, job-ready skills that employers are seeking. The program has been developed in response to identified industry needs and a skills shortage in this field. Today's lab environment requires technicians with skills in information technology, data management and data analysis. The college has programs, courses and faculty who specialize in these areas, as well as state-of-the-art technology to support the use of applied technology in laboratory environments. Students will benefit from Fleming's growing faculty expertise in this field. As well, Fleming College is a founding partner in the Greater Peterborough Innovation Cluster. This strategic alliance between local private and public sector partners was created to advance local research of DNA and forensic science and develop economic growth opportunities, new technology businesses and jobs for the Peterborough region.
Work Experience
A 600-hour placement will immerse students in the work culture of a lab environment, give them the opportunity to seek experience in an area of specialization, and promote networking and awareness of the industry and job potential. Students will work with their faculty in selecting a placement that will be right for them.
Is this You?
To succeed in this occupation, students need the following characteristics:
Problem-solving, troubleshooting, creativity.
Perseverance, time management, and organization.
Life-long learner to maintain currency in an ever-changing field.
In addition, students should enjoy synthesizing information, finding innovative solutions to problems, and working with equipment and instruments at tasks which require precision. Students will likely work in a team environment, so good interpersonal and communication skills are essential.
Career Opportunities
Program graduates will be qualified to work in various biotechnology related settings (i.e. private versus public), in a variety of roles. Examples include but are not limited to:
Research technician/technologist (in areas such as cancer, disease, environmental, etc.)
Microbiology testing (food, water, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics).
Quality assurance/quality control (food, pharmaceutical, manufacturing).
Forensic labs.
Hospital and clinical settings.
Pharmaceutical companies.
Government agencies such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Canadian, Centre for Forensic Science, and Public Health.
Municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment facilities.
Pathogen and toxicology testing (plant and animals).
Wildlife management and restoration (environmental DNA).
Cannabis labs.
COVID19 testing and medical related fields (may require additional qualifications).
Chemical analysis and instrumentation.
Nuclear power generation
Mature Students
If you are 19 years of age or older before classes start, and you do not possess an OSSD, you can write the
Canadian Adult Achievement Test
to assess your eligibility for admission. Additional testing or academic upgrading may be necessary to meet specific course requirements for this program.
