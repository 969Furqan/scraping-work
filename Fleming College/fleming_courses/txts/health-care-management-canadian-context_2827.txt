Program Highlights
This program prepares leaders from various healthcare backgrounds to learn the skills necessary to manage in diverse environments within the Canadian healthcare setting. Firmly rooted in a Canadian and provincial healthcare context, with a strong focus on Indigenous perspectives, this program will prepare you to become a partner in care, lead interprofessional healthcare teams, and be adept in the ever-changing landscape of the Canadian healthcare system.
You will gain business and leadership fundamentals and foundational knowledge in finance, human resources, health equity, truth and reconciliation, and change management through a mix of online and intensive in-person learning. A work-integrated learning experience in form of a capstone project or placement will consolidate your new skills and knowledge.
Why Fleming
This accelerated, hybrid program allows you to finish sooner and complete portions of the curriculum away from the college. The integrated learning option of either a capstone project or placement in the final semester is a unique feature of this program in Ontario. A strong emphasis on Indigenous truth and reconciliation as well as Indigenous community health care needs is interwoven in the program.
