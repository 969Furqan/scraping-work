Courses and Descriptions
Curriculum:  September 2025
Semester 1
Delivery: In Person
Dendrology
FSTY   7
Units/ Hours: 60
This course deals with the identification of approximately 125 trees and shrubs found in urban settings in Ontario.  Tree features including leaves, twigs, bark and fruits are studied.  The accuracy level for the identification tests is 80 per cent.  The lecture series includes:  the anatomy and physiology of leaves, stems, roots and flowers, fruit adaptations for seed dispersal and forest geography.  The cultural requirements of the major urban tree species are studied.
Field Skills
ECOS  13
Units/ Hours: 60
This course will focus on three areas of study: identification, field and lab skills. Students will identify and classify the living and non-living components of the specific ecosystems described in the Ecology and Environment (ENVR 20) course. Field skills to be developed include the ability to navigate through the natural environment and use a variety of ecosystem inventory techniques. Special emphasis will be placed on safe work habits in lab and field.
Forest Fire Science
FSTY  12
Units/ Hours: 45
The ecological role of fire in Canada's boreal forest is one of renewal.  Many species rely on wildfires for creating conditions to favour their regeneration: this creates a rich, ecologically diverse landscape that supports many species, both tree and animal, on which economies are based.  One theme of this course will be to strengthen knowledge and application of initial attack fire suppression tactics and strategies.  The role of fire as a silvicultural tool (e.g. prescribed burning) will be the second major theme of this course.
Introduction to Indigenous Studies
INDG  49
Units/ Hours: 45
This course is an introduction to the study of Indigenous (First Nations, Metis, and Inuit) peoples in Canada. Students will explore the complex historical and contemporary relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. The course will also guide students to begin to understand the diversity and depth of Indigenous societies, worldviews, and knowledge through a multi-disciplinary lens.
Operation and Maintenance of Equipment
MECH  45
Units/ Hours: 90
Students are instructed in the safe operation and maintenance of equipment associated with the arboriculture and utility industries.  Chainsaw operation and tree felling techniques are competency-based standards set out by the Professional Chainsaw Operation guidelines by Workplace Safety North. The techniques introduced in this course are transferable to other courses within the program. Students will be required to purchase items of personal protective equipment (safety glasses, safety boots, chainsaw pants, safety gloves, hard hat, and hearing protection) as recommended, before the course begins.
Semester 2
Delivery: In Person
Career Preparation
APST 154
Units/ Hours: 30
This course is designed to equip students with the skills needed for their work search and to develop and enhance career planning skills.  Students will learn how to write competitive job search documents, interview with confidence, and will develop and use their career portfolio as a tool to identify and incorporate career goals into the job search process.
Forest Measurement
FSTY  73
Units/ Hours: 45
In Forest Measurements students will continue to learn about the tools and techniques to measure and describe forestry data. Through laboratory sessions and field trips and using different industry standard sampling methods students will become proficient at measuring tree height, diameter and volume. Students will then use these data for stand calculations including species, compositions, basal area, stems per hectare, volumes and yields as well as site class and site index.
Forest Products: Utilization and Scaling
FSTY  16
Units/ Hours: 45
This course provides insight into the traditional end uses of wood products and by-products.  Topics such as dimensional lumber saw milling, veneer production, and pulp and paper technology for roundwood, chips, and recycled paper will be covered. Throughout the course, the techniques of wood scaling and measurement will be presented.  This course provides students with a sound understanding of the variety of wood end uses.  Students will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the use of bandsaw mills.
Intro to Silviculture Operations
FSTY 127
Units/ Hours: 45
Students will be introduced to forest harvesting operations including terminology and equipment. Following the provincial tree marking guidelines students will be introduced to the application of silvicultural treatments and conservation.
Soils and Ecosystems
NATR 129
Units/ Hours: 45
The Soils and Ecosystems course will focus on developing the practical skills necessary to assess the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils and other substrates as they relate to plant growth and distribution.  Students will learn how to classify all substrates according to the Ecological Land Classification System of Ontario, but the emphasis will be on mineral and organic forest soils. An understanding of the relationship between substrates and their landform and topography will be a central theme of the course.
Wildlife Observation Skills
FIWI  41
Units/ Hours: 45
This course is an introduction to a range of skills in wildlife observation. A variety of wildlife species may be present in an environment despite not being seen. Important skills include visual and auditory identification of wildlife signs. The primary emphasis in this course will be on identification of wildlife signs such as tracks, trail patterns, scat, skulls, impacts on the environment, bird song and amphibian calls. Documentation of wildlife observation will be practiced regularly. Field guides, photography, binoculars and spotting scopes will be used to document wildlife sightings and their signs.
Woody Plant Propagation
FSTY  76
Units/ Hours: 45
This course deals with woody plant propagation within greenhouse and bare-root nurseries for both natural and urban landscapes as well as for forest management. This course also addresses preservation and care of horticultural plants for human well-being in urban settings.  Topics include tree seed processing, stratification, germination, seedling culture, cutting propagation, nursery soils, fertilizers, irrigation, and quality control. Special emphasis will be placed on plant selection, plant growth and responses, horticultural practices, preventative maintenance, nursery stock handling, plant-to-soil relationships, and overall seedling physiology.
