Program Highlights
In the Carpenter apprenticeship program, you'll combine your three in-school Basic, Intermediate and Advanced sessions of 240 hours each with work experience. Instructors who have many years of practical experience in the trade, and related expertise, will give you the essentials you need to know to be a competent carpenter.
There's an increasing demand for carpenters with the current economic trend toward renovation and new construction. Take pride in a job well done - as a carpenter, you'll get to see the results of all your hard work, enjoy variety in work and projects, and make a good living.
Carpentry is a Red Seal trade which means registered apprenticeships are eligible to receive government-funded grants and incentives.
