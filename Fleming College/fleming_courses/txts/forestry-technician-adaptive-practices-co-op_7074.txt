Program Highlights
As a Forestry Technician, you will be part of a close-knit community of men and women across the country who are making a difference in our environment. In this two-year program, you’ll learn to work effectively in natural resources management, gaining traditional forestry skills such as compassing and tree identification along with more technical skills working with ArcMap, GPS and other high-tech software.
This program is delivered in-person and combines theory with technical hands-on experiences including a paid co-op, numerous field excursions, and our unique field camp experience. With a focus on managing the forests of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence and Boreal Forest regions for resilience in the face of climate change, graduates will be equipped to carry out technical functions relating to the creation, management, conservation, and restoration of sustainable forests in both public and private operations with a specialization in adaptive practices. These adaptive practices include responses to environmental, social and economic changes within industry.
The curriculum exceeds provincial program standards and better positions graduates for a pathway to applied degrees - bringing them closer to achieving the Registered Professional Forester (RPF) designation.
Students that successfully complete all the components of the felling course will receive their Workplace Safety North Professional Chainsaw Operators certificate. You can further increase your credentials, career readiness, and versatility by completing the next step towards your tree marking certification by challenging the provincial tree marking exams through a two-day review and field test at the end of your last semester. There is an additional cost of $400.00 for this, and it requires additional job training and evaluation to become fully certified.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
Co-op
Students in the program will participate in a mandatory paid co-op. The co-op provides the opportunity to:
Integrate classroom learning with work-based learning
Explore the variety of careers available in the field
Network for future job opportunities
In addition to paying tuition and fees for 4 semesters of study, students participating in the co-op pay a co-op fee (approximately $558.00) for administrative costs associated with the co-op placement.
International Exchange
Want to gain an international perspective on forestry? Through an international exchange program, you can visit Europe for as little as three weeks or as long as one semester, attending courses at our partner institution - the University of Padua in Legnaro, Italy.
Success Stories
With a smaller college size and such a positive learning atmosphere it made me excited about going to class each and every day. All the teachers and field trips truly provided me with the knowledge and tools to achieve great careers in the forestry industry. Since graduating, I've worked with the OMNRF as an Assistant Forest Technician where I collected research data on invasive insects and diseases that are drastically altering the landscapes of our forests. We also tested out many preventative measures for possible solutions to ensure the next generation of trees are healthy and managed. Currently, I am working in the recently burned areas of northern British Columbia. I have been mapping boundaries for different types of cut blocks, probing for invasive species, assessing the health of trees, and performing silviculture surveys in stands affected by fungal diseases.

traditions, skills, teachings and science of Indigenous knowledge. Students will learn how different indigenous communities interact with forest ecosystems and some of the traditional names and uses of plants and wildlife and grow their two-eyed seeing.
Practical Ecology and Silvics
FSTY 133
Units/ Hours: 165
This course integrates forest navigation, GIS, data collection, ecology and silvics, report writing and presentations through a combination of field work, lectures, and labs. Weekly field trips will be used to conduct surveys in a variety of forest types in various stages of development so that
students can explore and learn about forest succession, forest ecology, tree auto-ecology, and silvicultural management. Using GIS, students will prepare themselves for the field by creating navigational maps and support their reports by interpreting aerial imagery and topography, creating basic databases, creating lines, points and polygons, and using cartographic representation. Students will upload their maps to their personal handheld device to use as a GPS and collect georeferenced data while in the field. As well, students will collect forest ecosystem data using industry standard methods and tools and will summarize their data and reporting on their findings in written reports and presentations. Each student will be required to have an up-to-date device (tablet / smart phone - Android or iPhone) with available file space that is able to use current apps, save data and work all day in the field in all conditions.
