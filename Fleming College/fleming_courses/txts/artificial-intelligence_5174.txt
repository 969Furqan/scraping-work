Program Highlights
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a two-semester Ontario College Graduate Certificate where students learn how to design and create software by embedding AI into applications that meet industry needs. Modern software design and AI frameworks, machine learning, and big data fundamentals are the basis of this program.
This program will be delivered in a hybrid format with online lectures and face-to-face computer labs where students will apply their knowledge and skills to applied projects. The program also includes applied research and applied learning experiences throughout the curriculum culminating in a second semester capstone project course.
Students will learn to obtain and analyze data sets in deep learning and machine learning applications, work collaboratively using principles of project management, and design and create software to fulfil industry project requirements. All work completed in the program will be in accordance with relevant legal statutes and ethical codes. In addition to gaining technical knowledge, students will expand their skills in project and time management, collaboration, independent initiative, and communication.
Why are these skills in demand?
