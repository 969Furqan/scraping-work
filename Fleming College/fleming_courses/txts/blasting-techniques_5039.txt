Program Highlights
Fascinated by the explosives industry? Do you like to work outdoors, and in challenging environments? If so, you may be interested in exploring a career as a blaster. With our well-developed connections with industry and our specialized resources and drilling compound, students get the hands-on training necessary for their career in blasting.
Blasters fill blast holes with explosives and detonate them to dislodge coal, ore, rock, or aggregate, or to demolish structures.
Blasters are employed by construction, mining, and drilling and blasting companies, as well as in the special effects industry.
You will focus on three types of explosive cuts, and incorporate a wide range of skills in science, mathematics, and communications.
Courses include explosives, blasthole drilling, blasting theory, blast design, geology, safety and accident prevention, and environmental issues.
You will spend much of your time in labs, field classes and field assignments, and refining your skills in our state-of-the-art drilling and blasting training centre.
Students who start the Blasting Techniques program in May and successfully complete the program, have the option to enter the second semester of the Resources Drilling Technician program in January and complete both programs in a total of 5 semesters (20 months).

Why Choose Fleming
Fleming's Blasting Techniques certificate has several advantages upon completion:
You will have common core training as a Surface Miner as required by the Ministry of Labour to enter most blasting sites.
Upon graduation, you will have the option of certifying with the International Society of Explosives Engineers (ISEE) in Quarrying, Basic Construction Blasting, and the Fundamentals of Blasting (Level One).
Another option upon graduation is to expand your career and job opportunities by continuing at Fleming College in the Resources Drilling Technician diploma program, with direct entry into the program's second semester (subject to availability).

An enjoyment of working outdoors/ hands-on work
Good motor skills
Physical health
Flexibility (particularly regarding hours of work)
Communication/interpersonal skills
Mechanical aptitude
Ability to plan and organize activities
Problem solving skills
Ability to work independently
Computer skills
Career Opportunities
Job opportunities are very good across many sectors and several provinces, including Ontario. With many blasters nearing retirement, there is an urgent need to replace these skilled individuals. Job titles include construction blaster, openpit blaster, and surface mining blaster. Blasters work closely with drillers and often perform both drilling and blasting activities. The annual salary range for a blaster/driller is $35,000 - $62,000, depending upon experience and certification. Fully qualified surface blasters make up to $50.00 per hour. Blasting assistants earn $23 - $30 per hour at the entry level (a union blaster's helper starts at $44). There are good opportunities for career advancement in this field with training and experience. Specialized areas of blasting such as underground blasting have higher pay scales.
Program Format
Blasting Techniques is a two-semester program. Students who start in September complete first semester in December, start second semester in January and complete the program in late April. Students who start in May complete first semester in August, begin second semester in September and complete the program in December.
Blasting Techniques graduates who choose to continue their studies in the Resources Drilling Technician program start semester two of this program in either May or January.
Please note: Students will be required to submit a Criminal Reference Check to attend the program.
