Program Highlights
This program will challenge you to do your personal best while you learn how to develop effective relationships with those who are in your care. Throughout the program you will learn what's needed to work with society's at-risk youth and adult populations through experiential and in-class training. Your courses will include a significant focus on human relations and communications skills, which are essential to your success in this field.
You will obtain the skills and training to work in diverse community and institutional settings. You may work with people who are currently involved, or who are at risk of becoming involved, with the criminal justice system, child welfare, or mental health systems. As well, you may work with people who are currently incarcerated, or who are experiencing difficulties as a result of addictions, anti-social behaviours, or a lack of appropriate supports.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
University Grad?
Are you a university graduate? You may be eligible for direct entry into second semester of this program and graduate in as little as 12 months. Contact the program co-ordinator for more information.
Why Choose Fleming
The Skills for Justice Scenario Lab at Fleming College is a unique teaching and learning space where faculty are able to involve students in scenarios to test skills and develop competencies in a safe and realistic setting. Access to community-based experiential training is also an integral part of the program. The 15-week field placement gives you a great deal of exposure to the field – and employers respect and value your training. Fleming College's CJS program has an excellent reputation across the province and beyond. Other community partnerships also afford students the opportunity to test their skills in real community and correctional environments throughout the four semesters of the program.
Work Experience
The field placement experience is a 15-week block, longer than placements in many other Community and Justice Service programs. During placement, you will be required to obtain a minimum of 520 hours in the field. Placements are available throughout the province and beyond, in correctional centres or community-based programs, including schools, residential treatment facilities and social service agencies. You will be required to submit a current police records check and vulnerable sector check to the placement agency prior to starting third semester. If you have been convicted of an offense under the Criminal Code for which you have not been pardoned or are flagged on a vulnerable sector check, you may be denied the opportunity to do a field placement. If you are deficient in one second semester course you will require a personal interview with the program coordinator to determine if field placement is possible. A student who is deficient in two or more courses will be unable to enroll in third semester until the transcript is complete and clear.
Is this You?
It's a definite asset if you've had volunteer or paid work experience working with people in crisis or in need, such as with Big Brothers/Sisters or in peer counselling. It also helps if you have:
effective interpersonal skills
patience
cultural sensitivity
effective conflict resolution/problem solving skills
emotional maturity
Career Opportunities
By the time you graduate, you will be well-qualified for employment and a rewarding career. Graduates of the Community and Justice Services program typically obtain employment in various agencies, programs and institutions in the correctional, child welfare and broader social service systems.
Correctional Services Canada
Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services
Ministry of Community and Social Services
Ministry of Children and Youth Services
privately operated group homes
other provincial correctional departments/ministries
community based social service agencies
The placement rate for Fleming graduates in related work is high. Expect to make an average starting salary of $30,000.00, and more with experience.

To qualify for an IPD, you must take and successfully complete a series of required Indigenous Studies courses as well as participate in a minimum of four approved co-curricular Indigenous events or experiences. Your transcript will indicate the IPD upon graduation, a designation that provides you with a comprehensive understanding of Indigenous cultures, histories, traditions, and contributions to our shared society within the context of your program of study. The IPD provides a valuable skill set sought after in today's employment sector.
