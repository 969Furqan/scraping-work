Program Highlights
As an Arboriculture graduate, you'll maintain and preserve trees and shrubs in the urban landscape and green spaces of our communities – providing cleaner air and much needed "green" relief from the concrete jungle.
The program offers theoretical knowledge for all aspects of urban tree care, as well as such practical skills as safe tree climbing techniques, aerial rescue, pruning techniques, tree removal, power line clearing, and the operation and maintenance of relevant equipment.
You will be able to identify approximately 140 species of trees and shrubs in both summer and winter conditions, and to diagnose and remedy major pests, disease, and tree disorders using the latest integrated management options to promote plant health.
In 2nd semester, you can take the Arborist and Utility Arborist exemption exams, to qualify you for the in-school portion of these MAESD apprenticeships (there is no additional cost to you for your first attempt at writing these tests).
Why Choose Fleming
Simply put, students choose our program because of our reputation in the arboriculture industry. Employers look to our Arboriculture program to find well-trained graduates.
School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences
has a long-standing reputation among professional organizations and employers working in the field. In 2007 the program received an Award of Merit from the International Society of Arboriculture, Ontario Chapter, for "advancing the principles, ideas and practice of Arboriculture in Ontario."
Double the Power of Your Credential
Many of our programs offer the opportunity to earn a second certificate or diploma with just one or two more semesters of study. Add another specialization to your skill set and increase your career prospects with this unique opportunity.
Learn more here
or contact your program coordinator for more information.
Work Experience
From start to finish, the Arboriculture program is hands-on - you'll be spending a lot of time working with trees and shrubs outside in addition to your time in the classroom.
There is a mandatory paid co-op semester from May to September.
In addition to paying tuition and fees for two semesters of study, students pay a co-op fee (approximately $558.00) for administrative costs associated with the co-op placement.

The accuracy level for the identification tests is 80 per cent.  The lecture series includes:  the anatomy and physiology of leaves, stems, roots and flowers, fruit adaptations for seed dispersal and forest geography.  The cultural requirements of the major urban tree species are studied.
Operation and Maintenance of Equipment
MECH  45
Units/ Hours: 90
Students are instructed in the safe operation and maintenance of equipment associated with the arboriculture and utility industries.  Chainsaw operation and tree felling techniques are competency-based standards set out by the Professional Chainsaw Operation guidelines by Workplace Safety North. The techniques introduced in this course are transferable to other courses within the program. Students will be required to purchase items of personal protective equipment (safety glasses, safety boots, chainsaw pants, safety gloves, hard hat, and hearing protection) as recommended, before the course begins.
Tree Climbing Fundamentals
FSTY   5
Units/ Hours: 90
Through in class and practical field labs, students will develop skills in safe tree climbing  techniques . The use of fall protection is mandatory at all times. Students will learn the use, care, and maintenance of equipment.  They will become safe and confident in pre-climb inspection, anchor selection, aerial rescue, and manoeuvring about in tree crowns. Students will be required to purchase personal protective equipment (safety glasses, safety boots, chainsaw pants, safety gloves, hard hat, and hearing protection) as recommended, before the course begins.

Students will continue to learn about the operation of a broad scope of industry related tools and equipment including loaders, cranes and sawmills.  A more in depth focus will be placed on mechanics such as hydraulic systems, trouble shooting and repair of equipment.
Forest Entomology and Pathology
FSTY  11
Units/ Hours: 45
Students of the Forestry, Arboriculture and Urban Forestry Certificate/Technician programs possess an excellent foundation in the 'normal growth' of trees. This course introduces students to the study of insects and diseases of forest and urban trees. Identification, classification, and control measures of commercially important insects, pathogens and diseases are examined. The emphasis is on the pests of forest and urban trees and a collection of such specimens.
Tree Health Management
FSTY  99
Units/ Hours: 60
Tree health management focuses on a thoughtful, holistic approach to successfully incorporating trees into the urban environment.  Learning proper planning, planting and establishment strategies, students will focus on prevention of tree health problems.  Students will develop the ability to diagnose damaging agents and prescribe required control or management measures using Integrated Pest Management and other industry mitigation techniques to maintain and establish healthy urban ecosystems.  The economic and social impacts of trees in the landscape will also be examined to aid in decision making processes.
