Program Highlights
NEW!
Get a $500 scholarship! We will be offering an industry-supported Drilling Scholarship for all eligible second semester students.
Our School offers the only college program in Canada providing training in Drilling, and we are the only program in the world offering training in so many of the different types of drilling. Numerous sectors rely on drilling skills, so this program opens doors to huge opportunities, many employers, and options to choose which field of drilling you will focus on. Our grads are in high demand. Every year, national and international employers recruit at our on-campus job fairs, and many of our students have employment offers before they graduate.
Currently, these fields offer employment opportunities for drilling careers:
Construction Drilling and Blasting
Geotechnical Drilling
Environmental Drilling
Water Well Drilling
Resources Drilling, including minerals and oil and gas exploration
Horizontal Directional Drilling
In our program, you'll learn the foundational theory, techniques and methods relating to each of these types of drilling, with an emphasis on safe working practices, while you learn to operate a full range of drilling equipment hands-on.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
Optional Co-op
Students entering the program in September may apply to participate in an optional paid co-op. The deadline to apply is at the end of November, where students must submit an Application Form (including a resume) to the Co-op Office. Students must achieve a 70% (2.5 GPA) average, and pass all courses in Semester 1 in order to be enrolled in the Co-op Option. Students who are accepted will participate in a Career Preparation course, and will do their co-op between semesters 2 and 3. The Co-op Option provides the opportunity to:
Integrate classroom learning with work-based learning
Explore the variety of careers available in the field
Network for future job opportunities
The Co-op Option is not available for students who begin the program in January, as they attend classes over the summer.
Please note:
In addition to paying tuition and fees for 4 semesters of study, students participating in the co-op pay a co-op fee (approximately $558.00) for administrative costs associated with the co-op placement.

Why are Drilling Skills in Demand?
People may assume that resources drilling, such as for minerals and oil and gas exploration, is the sector where most graduates find work. In fact, there are numerous types of drilling required for a variety of industries and projects, with excellent job prospects:
Geotechnical Drilling is required before any large construction project can begin. This involves subsurface investigations to evaluate property for infrastructure development, drilling for soil samples, determining soil type and depth, and ground conditions.
Construction Drilling includes drilling foundations and anchoring piles for bridges, roadwork, or for any large building or development.
Environmental Drilling involves obtaining samples of soil and groundwater, to control or remediate contaminants. Sites such as fuel service stations, landfills, mining operations, or abandoned infrastructures are examined, to either monitor or to reclaim the land for other purposes.
Drilling skills are essential for water well design, installation and monitoring.
Horizontal Directional Drilling is used to drill underneath structures such as roadways, foundations, or other properties, or beneath lakes, rivers or streams. The goal is to create a below-ground conduit, providing a transportation solution for waterlines, electrical lines, pipelines, or fibre-optic cables, for example.
Geothermal Drilling, to install geothermal heating or cooling systems, is another growing field.
The Skills You Need to Succeed
Our well-rounded program provides the courses and hands-on experience you need to begin a career in this exciting and varied sector. A full 80% of the program consists of practical learning sessions - in our state-of-the-art, on-campus Parnham Training Centre, and off-campus in the field. You'll also be challenged to think on your feet and use your problem-solving skills.
You'll work on a full range of drilling equipment in our five service bays.
Four specially equipped classrooms/labs feature everything from a drilling simulator to hands-on drilling activities.
Course work includes an introduction to emerging fields, such as the geothermal industry.
You'll get industry recognition for your studies. Our grads are exempt from taking the mandatory Ontario Ministry of the Environment 10-day Water Well Constructed Course. (Ontario Regulation 903 requires successful completion of this training for new well technicians.)
Why Choose Fleming
Our unique program offers a rare combination of technical training, theory and hands-on experience. Due to our strong connections with the industry, and our geographical location, the program is well positioned to place graduates throughout North America and globally. Employers know our grads have a good foundation of theory and practice, as well as excellent transferrable skills to draw upon for any challenge in the workplace.
Double the Power of Your Credential
Many of our programs offer the opportunity to earn a second certificate or diploma with just one or two more semesters of study. Add another specialization to your skill set and increase your career prospects with this unique opportunity.

or contact your program coordinator for more information.
Common First Semester
Students in our School's diploma programs take the same courses for first semester after choosing and being accepted into one of our programs. This common focus exposes you to a variety of career options and other programs. You will have the freedom to explore and obtain a multidisciplinary perspective, while you acquire a base of knowledge and fundamental skills.
Although students are accepted into a specific program for their first semester, the common first semester allows you to change direction if you find another program or career area is more appealing. Once you have successfully completed the common first semester, you can enter the program of your choice in second semester, subject to enrolment capacity.
Geoff Clark
is the Coordinator for Common First Semester.
Work Experience
Following your first semester, you'll begin to explore specialized training in drilling. As mentioned, you'll spend most of your time in labs or field classes, putting your education to work and refining your skills. You'll also take part in field assignments in local quarries and job-related activities.
Is this You?
You've got to love working outside, enjoy hands-on work, be willing to operate equipment, and be independently minded. Opportunities exist for both men and women - more brains than brawn is required to be competent in the field. Some of the personality traits and skills essential to your success include:
good motor skills and physical health
flexibility (particularly regarding hours of work)
interpersonal skills
analytical and creative thinking skills
mechanical aptitude
ability to lift 40 kilograms
able to stand for 12 hours
able to read and understand safety labels
Career Opportunities
Faculty report that the requests for graduates by industry often exceed the number of students completing this program. Upon graduation you'll find yourself in positions such as driller or helper. You may work in an urban, rural, or more remote area, throughout Canada, North America, or around the world. At least ten global industries are open to you for potential employment, including: Construction Drilling, Geotechnical, Environmental, Blast-hole drilling, Blasting, Mineral Exploration and Mining (surface and underground), Horizontal Directional Drilling, Geothermal, Water Wells Construction Drilling, and Oil and Gas industries.
You can move up the ladder to own a business, or work in sales, tech support, or management with larger companies. Your potential employment is excellent as a graduate of our one-of-a-kind program. The average starting annual income is $52,000.00 but you could make much more than that within a few years after graduation. Even as a summer student employee, it is possible to earn $20,000.00 to $30,000.00.
