Program Highlights
This program is designed to provide you with the core knowledge, skills and abilities fundamental to academic success in health sciences and other related programs at the advanced diploma or degree level. Develop your knowledge and skills in writing and research, mathematics, human anatomy, biology, and organic/inorganic chemistry to be well-prepared for the rigors of your next academic program. The program will provide you with extensive hands-on, laboratory-based learning experience in preparation for post-secondary level science programs. You will also have the opportunity to learn about potential careers in the health sciences and to identify other programs focusing on the biological or chemical sciences that will enable you to achieve your career objectives. This is a two-semester certificate-level program leading to an Ontario College Certificate.
If a career in nursing is your goal:
Successful completion of this Pre-Health Sciences pathway program provides the essential courses to meet admission requirements for the Trent/Fleming Bachelor of Science in Nursing program.
Admission to the B.Sc.N. program is competitive. Meeting the minimum admission requirements does not guarantee acceptance into the B.Sc.N. program.
If further degree studies in the field of health science or science is your goal:
Graduates of the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees program can pursue the Queen's University
Bachelor of Health Sciences Degree (Honours)
. Graduates with a 3.0 GPA are eligible, and will be awarded 12 credit hours, which is equivalent to nearly one semester of credit.
Successful completion of the Pre-Health Sciences pathway program provides the essential courses to meet application requirements to the Trent Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) program. Graduates with a minimum 65% average will be considered for entry.
Graduates may also meet admission criteria for programs at other universities.
Students interested in applying to other B.Sc.N. or B.Sc. programs are advised to consult with the admission office at the specific institution they are interested in for more information. For additional details, contact the Pre-Health Sciences program coordinator.
If a Fleming College Advanced Diploma is your goal:
Successful completion of this pathway program enables you to apply for admission for Fleming College programs such as:
Biotechnology - Advanced
Massage Therapy
Graduates may also be eligible for admission to similar programs at other Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology.
Students interested in applying to Fleming's
Practical Nursing
or
Paramedic
program should consider the
Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Certificates and Diplomas
program.

Courses and Descriptions
Curriculum:  September 2025
Semester 1
Delivery: Hybrid
Academic Writing and Research I
COMM  19
Units/ Hours: 45
Academic Writing & Research 1 is an introductory course that provides a foundation in college and university level communications by teaching students to read critically, write appropriately for a variety of audiences and purposes, conduct and cite research, and revise for clarity and correctness. Students are required to read weekly modules and complete weekly writing assignments. Through reflection and research, students will create a plan for their studies at Fleming and beyond. Students will use APA-style documentation to cite sources in all writing done in this course.
General & Human Biology I
SCIE 167
Units/ Hours: 60
Students will have the opportunity to investigate the molecular basis of life as they study topics in cellular structure and function, metabolism, reproduction, and gene expression. The underlying concepts and principles of biology will be applied to the study of the human body as students are introduced to the various organ systems and core theme of homeostasis. An applied laboratory component will allow students to deepen their understanding of theoretical concepts using scientific investigation.
General and Organic Chemistry I
SCIE 169
Units/ Hours: 60
Throughout the duration of this introductory chemistry course, students will prepare for further study and future employment in health related fields.  Students will engage in topics such as matter & energy, basic periodic trends and atomic structure, nomenclature of ionic and covalent compounds, VSEPR theory and chemical reactions and quantities including the mole. The laboratory component of the course will provide opportunities to consolidate theoretical concepts in a hands-on approach.
Mathematics for the Sciences
MATH  20
Units/ Hours: 60
This course will reinforce fundamental pre-algebra and algebra skills while preparing the student mathematically for study and work in health science and other science-related fields. Topic coverage will include the real number system, functions and function notation, simplifying expressions, evaluating, solving and graphing functions (linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric), solving problems involving right- and non-right triangles, and solving systems of equations and inequalities using a variety of techniques.  Students will apply their knowledge to solve health science and science-related problems.
General Education Elective
Units/ Hours: 45
All graduates of diploma programs
require general education credits
. These courses allow you to explore issues of societal concern by looking at the history, theory and contemporary applications of those issues.
Your program has designated some required general education courses. In addition, you have the opportunity to
choose from a list of electives
each semester.
Many of these courses and some other general education courses are also available through evening classes, by distance education, or on-line. See our Part-Time Studies Calendar for these opportunities.
You may already possess general education equivalencies from other colleges or universities. Please see the General Education Co-ordinators at the Peterborough and Lindsay locations for possible exemptions.
In PHS semester 1, students can choose either a general education elective or SCIE156 Introduction to College Physics.
Semester 2
Delivery: Hybrid
Academic Writing and Research II
COMM  20
Units/ Hours: 45
The second half of English I continues to emphasize consolidation of literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills.  Students will analyse a range of challenging texts from various time periods, countries, and cultures: write analytical and argumentative essays and a major paper for an independent literary research project: and apply key concepts to analyse media works.  An important focus will be on understanding academic language and using it coherently and confidently in discussion and argument.
Pre-Requisites
Academic Writing and Research I (COMM  19)
General & Human Biology II
SCIE 168
Units/ Hours: 60
This course follows General and Human Biology I to further enable students to develop a foundation in the biological sciences as well as human anatomy and physiology. Students will continue to study theory and conduct applied laboratory investigations on various topics, including the organ systems responsible for control, coordination, and maintenance of the human body.
Pre-Requisites
General & Human Biology I (SCIE 167)
General & Organic Chemistry II
SCIE 170
Units/ Hours: 60
In this course, students will broaden their understanding of introductory concepts established in General and Organic Chemistry I. Topics in the first part of the course will include solutions, and reaction rates & equilibrium, including acid-base equilibrium. The second half of the course emphasizes alignment between chemical concepts acquired early on in the course with organic chemistry, culminating in the study of metabolic pathways involving biomolecules in the human body. The laboratory component of the course will provide opportunities to consolidate theoretical concepts in a hands-on approach.
Pre-Requisites
General and Organic Chemistry I (SCIE 169)
Introduction to Psychology
SOCI  36
Units/ Hours: 45
This course offers a systematic approach to exploring human behaviour. The concepts and empirical findings are examined using a variety of theoretical approaches. Major topics include perception, motivation, learning, memory, intelligence, and personality.
Introductory Statistics for the Sciences
MATH  21
Units/ Hours: 60
This introductory statistics course will prepare students for study and work in health science and other science-related fields.  Concepts studied include numerical and graphical summaries of data, correlation, probability, and an introduction to inferential statistics.  Students will apply their knowledge and use technology to organize large amounts of information, describe and interpret data from science and health care related fields.
