Program Highlights
This pathway program is designed to prepare you for admission to college programs in health sciences, biological or chemical sciences, while you learn about possible careers in these fields. The program provides the knowledge and skills in communication, mathematics, human anatomy, biology and chemistry needed to be successful in related college programs. Upon successful completion of this two-semester program, you will be eligible for admission to college programs such as:
Health Information Management
Occupational Therapist Assistant and Physiotherapist Assistant
Paramedic
Pharmacy Technician
Practical Nursing
Fleming College has reserved space in the above-noted programs for qualified graduates of this program. For consideration in this category, graduates must have achieved an average of 70% or higher over the duration of the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway program. If there are more applications from graduates with 70% or higher than reserved seats available, a selection process based on an average of overall marks will take place.
To be considered for your program of choice, your Ontario College application must be received by the
Equal Consideration Application Deadline
date.
While taking the Pathway to Certificates and Diplomas program you will explore program options. If you find that a career in health sciences is not as appealing as you had thought, you may consider other Fleming programs. Fleming College has also reserved space in the following programs for qualified graduates of the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Certificates and Diplomas:
Fitness and Health Promotion
Mental Health And Addiction Worker
Pre-Service Firefighter Education and Training
Social Service Worker
Throughout the Pre-Health Sciences program, you will learn in a supportive environment and gain hands-on experience in our chemistry and biology labs. Our health curriculum is integrated, and you will also take college-level courses to help you become a competent communicator and problem solver, with the critical analytical, creative and logical thinking skills needed in the workplace. In addition, you can earn from two to four credits towards your subsequent college diploma, depending upon your program choice.
Please note: International students are not eligible to enter the Paramedic program directly, or through the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Certificates and Diplomas.
Is this You?
To succeed in this program, you require:
strong oral and written communication skills
ability to work as part of a team, as well as independently
commitment to making your education work
good time management and organizational skills
willingness to explore your options
Additional Costs
In addition you should plan to spend at least $700 per year for books and supplies.
