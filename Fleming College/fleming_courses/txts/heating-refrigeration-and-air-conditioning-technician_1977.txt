Program Highlights
Protecting the environment, reducing climate changes and increasing sustainable practices have contributed to the need for energy-efficient practices in the heating, refrigeration and air conditioning industry.
Our compressed three-semester diploma program will prepare you for employment in this field:
Our program has been specifically designed to address the changing employment and environmental needs of the industry and includes the course, Mech 222 — Renewable Energy Sources, focusing on geothermal and solar in comparison to more traditional heating and cooling systems.
Our program provides you with theoretical and practical skills to install, service, maintain and update heating, refrigeration and air conditioning systems.
The program is divided into three terms.
After successful completion of the provincial practical requirements at the end of term one, students can apply to write for Oil Burner Technician – Level 3 (OBT-3) and Gas Technician – Level 3 (G-3) certificates of qualification.
After successful completion of the provincial practical requirements at the end of term three, students can apply to write for Oil Burner Technician – Level 2 (OBT-2) and Gas Technician – Level 2 (G-2) certificates of qualification.
Students are required to attend 80% of all classes in order to write their TSSA Gas and Oil exams.
Gas and Oil Technician – Level 3 (OBT-3 and G-3) deals with workplace safety, tools, characteristics of natural gas and oil, codes/regulations, basic electricity, technical specifications, customer relations, basic piping systems, and an introduction to gas and oil appliances.
Gas and Oil Technician – Level 2 (OBT-2 and G-2) focuses on advanced piping/tubing systems, electricity, controls, systems, appliances, gas meters, pressure regulators, gas and oil-fired refrigerators, conversion burners, water heaters, forced warm air heating systems, hydronic heating systems, space heating, venting practices, forced air add-on devices, and air handling.
Graduates of this program will have an opportunity to obtain industry related health and safety certifications. You will also have Grade 12 Math equivalency.
Success Story
I came from a sales background in electronics and had very little hands-on experience with tools. A friend had taken the Fleming Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technician (HRAC) program and suggested I take it too. After some research, I applied and nervously entered the program. I wasn't sure what to expect or if I would be able to succeed in a trades environment, but the instructors were extremely patient and understanding. They started with the basic of the basics and built my foundation of knowledge up. Every course had unique challenges but the instructors had my back every step of the way. They assured me that with the right attitude and effort I would be successful, they hit the nail right on the head! By third semester I was much more confident in my abilities and kept building on that foundation from previous semesters. The individual lessons and topics started to come together, I was making connections, and started to see “HVAC” as a whole.
I am in the career and position I am today because of the Fleming HRAC team! I learned so much and still am because of what they have instilled in me: Never Stop Learning.
J. Schnettler, Graduate (2018)
