Program Highlights
Make history come alive, create meaningful stories by documenting and preserving our heritage for today and future generations.
Museum Managers and Curators don't just preserve the relics, stories, and memorabilia of the past. They animate and interpret it, bringing history to life for people of all ages and stages. Put your university degree or college diploma to work in the service of a society that needs to know its past -- in order to inform its future.
You will take this post-graduate certificate program during three consecutive semesters. The program is designed to meet the needs of students who want to acquire applied skills-based training for careers in the museum/gallery or heritage sectors. The courses have been developed in consultation and co-operation with museums and heritage organizations in order to offer a real, not simulated, work experience. Updated curriculum reflects practical applications of theory, beyond best practices rooted in ethical applications. The program is an optimal blend of independent study, in-class lectures, discussion, group work, applied projects, experience based and priceless hands-on learning.
The Peterborough Museum & Archives, a City-owned and operated institution, is the program's main learning partner, and has designated spaces for Fleming students. This is where you will attend the majority of your lectures. As well, you will do practical training at this museum. Find out more information about the museum at:
www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca
Students find it more convenient to look for accommodation near the museum or downtown, as opposed to on campus.
Classes are also held in the dedicated conservation laboratory and computer labs at the College's Sutherland Campus.
By being immersed in museum work, you'll experience the complexity and diversity of tasks/duties in small to medium-sized museums or galleries and acquire training to be an expert generalist. You will need to complete site work, research, and group projects and be prepared for off-campus teaching outside of "regular" day classes.
Please note:
This program is extremely time-intensive, including class time, lab time, demonstrations and simulations, site visits, twilight classes, working in situ on applied projects and working in teams. Students who are able to fully commit their time enjoy the most success, and benefit greatly from the program's authentic learning experience and assessments.
Success Stories
The Museum Management and Curatorship program at Fleming College provided me with a rewarding, hands-on, and well-rounded museum experience. All of the courses offered, provided information that I still use today. The courses in Collections Management, Exhibit Design, Curatorial Research, Education and Interpretive Programming, Museum Administration, Archival Management, Care of Collections, and the Internship create a well-rounded experience. As a graduate of the program and a supervisor since then, I often look for students from the program when hiring. I find the students from Fleming are independent, have great hands-on experience, and already come with a well-rounded foundation. Faculty were extremely friendly and approachable. I definitely recommend the program. I wouldn’t be where I am today without it.
Amber Laurie, Program Graduate - Assistant Curator/Registrar of Marine History, Nova Scotia Museum Collections Unit, Maritime Museum of the Atlantic
Deciding to attend Fleming College’s Museum Management and Curatorship program was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable, drawing from their own extensive experience in museum work, and are passionate, kind educators who provide all the skills necessary to succeed in the field. As a partner with the Peterborough Museum and Archives, the program allowed me to gain real-world experience through a number of practical assignments that has been instrumental in securing employment. I am very grateful for everything the program taught me and would recommend Fleming College to anyone interested in the heritage field.
Emily Dykeman, Program Graduate - Collections Assistant - Tom Thomson Art Gallery
The Fleming Museum Management and Curatorship program’s broad course content allowed me to gain hands-on experience working with artefacts, developing exhibits, and creating educational programming while still having a solid focus on the day-to-day operational demands of museums. The program provided me with the strong and varied foundation necessary to administer a community museum and allowed me to identify areas of museum work that I am most passionate about.
Margaret Mulrooney, Program Graduate - Curator/Administrator, Colchester Historeum
As a museum manager, I have found interns and graduates from the Fleming Museum Management and Curatorship and Cultural Heritage Conservation and Management programs to be motivated, skilled and committed to a career in the heritage sector. Following a recent nationwide search for an Assistant Curator/Collections Coordinator, our top two choices out of more than 250 applicants were both Fleming grads."

Why Choose Fleming
The Museum Management and Curatorship program is one of the few available to students interested in this field and is unique in Canada, in that it is actually based at a museum. The post-graduate certificate is highly regarded by heritage and cultural institutions, galleries, museums, and graduates. The program benefits from strong partnerships and support from museums and galleries both in Ontario and across the country.
Work Experience
Due to the nature of this program, a significant amount of time is spent working in teams in the field, and on practical projects.
The third and final semester is a challenging, full-time, four-month, curriculum-based internship at an approved site. This will give you hands-on work experience where you will put your hard work and studies into action. Students should be prepared to relocate for the internship, to pay full tuition, and be self-supporting. The internship is usually an unpaid study experience. You will negotiate your own internship with faculty assistance and some students have participated in internships abroad. Students are responsible for negotiating additional paperwork and funding requirements for international internships including visas, travel and insurance. Some examples of internship locations include:
Metro Toronto Zoo
Museum of Ontario Archaeology
National Trust, England
Nova Scotia Museums
Ontario Museum Association
Peterborough Museum & Archives
Provincial Archives Associations
Robert McLaughlin Gallery
Royal Ontario Museum
Royal Tyrrell Museum
UBC Museum of Anthropology
All course work must be successfully completed in order to be eligible for the internship. Satisfactory completion of the internship is a prerequisite for graduation.

Curatorial Research Methods
MUSM   6
Units/ Hours: 45
Curatorial research is motivated by two things: a love of objects, and a fascination with the ways in which they speak about the past and present.  The care of artifacts (i.e., objects within a museum context) cannot stop at identification and physical conservation.  Identification must be seen as part of a larger task: an exploration of the social and cultural significance of objects in relation to each other and to the people who made, used, and kept them.  Conservation must include preservation of the  information accompanying an object, information beyond personal institutional provenance, or artifact type.  Finally, curatorial research entails a critical awareness of our own culturally-bound responses to artifacts. This course prepares students for collections research in the museum environment, and for the challenge of developing meaning and value for those collections in a regional context.  Emphasis is placed on the importance of the museum research function, and the use of a relatively new approach to historical research - material history. Each 3 hour session integrates presentations, group work and discussion, case studies, and independent research.  In addition, the instructor will facilitate visits from guest lecturers.
