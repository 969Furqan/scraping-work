Program Highlights
In this program you will develop a powerful focus throughout the process of looking, thinking, making, and talking about visual artworks. These skills are essential in art making, regardless of your choice of visual media and medium. Experiences in and outside the classroom will expand your perspective on both current art practices, and your pathway into that world. This perspective allows you to make the best choices in your pursuit of future careers in your own studio practice, in the fine art or cultural sector, or in a commercial art enterprise.
You will develop your portfolio and artist’s documents in the VCAD program, which will provide you with a gateway to more advanced studies through our articulation agreements with major Canadian art education institutions.
Start with the first two semesters of required foundation courses, and then select one of our accelerated studio art certificates to complete your two-year Ontario College Diploma. You can complete your VCAD experience in just three semesters of time.
VCAD = Foundation courses + your choice of one studio certificate

Why Choose Fleming
This program is delivered at Fleming College's Haliburton Campus, located in central Ontario's spectacular Haliburton Highlands region and home to the Haliburton School of Art + Design,
Surrounded by incredible natural beauty, Haliburton is a vibrant artistic community where you will have the opportunity to leave behind the everyday world and immerse yourself in a truly creative environment. From day one, you are viewed as artist and designer colleague; our role is to share our expertise and mentor you to become the creative person and professional you are meant to be.
The campus is designed for students to thrive: class sizes are small, delivered in over 30,000 square feet of dedicated studio space. Our broad range of diverse studio-based programming gives students the opportunity to explore many different disciplines and media.
Equivalent to two semesters of full-time study, our accelerated 15-week certificates provide over 600 hours of hands-on studio time. Each week you will work and learn alongside a different faculty member who brings their unique perspective and expertise within the discipline to the studio, enhancing your understanding of the breadth of the art form, and building multiple skills and techniques.
Because our enrolment is capped, you always have access to equipment, room to work, and time to interact with faculty and other artists in your program. You will also benefit from the guidance of experienced studio technicians and extended hours in the studio after class.
Certificates are offered as stand-alone programs and in conjunction with this diploma program and the Integrated Design diploma program.
Graduate Profile
After my VCAD year i took drawing and painting, as well as digital image design. Where VCAD had structured my thinking and my art making, the certificate programs allowed me to stretch my legs a bit. The faculty leave you room to create, while providing all sorts of support and advice that they've garnered through years of perfecting their own practice."

Courses and Descriptions
Curriculum:  January 2025
Semester 1
Delivery: In Person
3D Design - Studio
ARTS 959
Units/ Hours: 45
In this course, students begin to use materials to explore formal three-dimensional design theory. Three-dimensional design encompasses art and non-art objects as well as the built environment. Through the creation of a series of three-dimensional forms the student increases their capacity to "think with materials" while developing personal choices in context, subject and meaning.   Interactive studio lectures, discussions, and collaborative activities will expand critical thinking and problem solving skills as students examine their relationship to three-dimensional design practices.
Art History - The Recent Century
ARTS 956
Units/ Hours: 45
This survey course provides an introduction to the major styles and movements of Western art history, from the sources of Impressionism to the end of the twentieth century. It will briefly reference the roots of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists from ancient art to the movements of Neo-Classicism and Romanticism. The course provides an important frame of reference for further explorations in contemporary art issues or art history. Using studio, lectures, research, and presentations, emphasis is placed on developing an understanding of the key styles, methods and principles of artists and art processes of interest to the individual student.
Contemporary Art Investigations
ARTS 957
Units/ Hours: 60
The contemporary artist can better understand themselves, their values, and their own works when related to the events constantly unfolding in current realms of art, craft, design, science, and technology. The boundaries of these worlds are disappearing as collaborative endeavors share the materials, techniques, and design processes in the pursuit of new insights. Through critical exercises, research, and presentations, students will develop a strengthened vision and vocabulary about visual art. They will engage in a study of the art world at various levels through studio tours, research, and critical discussion. Emphasis will be placed on appreciation of the wealth of insights afforded by the well-structured critique. This course will include a three day visit to a variety of urban arts venues; a rich experience which will support the establishment of personal themes and goals in the students' own visual arts practices.
Design I
ARTS 960
Units/ Hours: 45
Effective works of art engage the viewer on sensory, emotional, and intellectual levels. Through an understanding of the principles and elements of design in the development of the art object, the student is better able to reflect on both their own work and that of others. This understanding affords insight into the way that certain aspects of a visual experience can stimulate responses in the audience. Students will realize the basic elements and principles of two-dimensional design through a variety of applied exercises using paint and collage in conjunction with examples from design history. Through research, discussion, critical thinking, and design projects, students begin to recognize and understand the powerful implications of different design solutions.
Digital Media
ARTS 963
Units/ Hours: 30
Students will use basic skills with digital media tools and devices to produce well-considered images for display in print and various digital formats. Applying the aspects of lighting, angles and positioning to a variety of subjects, they will begin to gather a collection of digital images for visual art works, artist's presentations, documents, web applications, and artist's portfolio. Attention will be given to developing basic skills in staging, lighting and framing work for the specified subject matter, output, and audience. Digital media tools and processes will be used in adjustment, cropping, and compositing for both layout and creative manipulation. Organization, storage and file names will be emphasized in conjunction with the design in selecting, editing, and sequencing a series of images.
Drawing Disciplines
ARTS 961
Units/ Hours: 45
In this overview of drawing practices, students will investigate these purposes and processes through research, sample drawings, and presentations. Visualization, ideation, notation and communication afford valuable processes for many types of art making. Rendering skills will be analyzed through depiction of a variety of subject matter. The application of drawing as an instrumental part of the design process will be explored. Students will also explore the properties of various drawing media and supports.
Media Explorations I
ARTS 962
Units/ Hours: 27
Artistic expression is accessed through a wide range of media and disciplines. In this course students will have the opportunity to visit specialized studio practices for a hands on experience. This will afford a direct insight into the tools, materials and potential interests that they may have in materials such as clay, metal, textiles, paint media, and traditional darkroom photography, as available in the fall semester. These experiences will allow the student to make better-informed choices as they continue their studies in visual arts as well as broader insights into works in these materials that they will encounter through images and gallery experiences.
Introduction to Indigenous Studies
INDG  49
Units/ Hours: 45
This course is an introduction to the study of Indigenous (First Nations, Metis, and Inuit) peoples in Canada. Students will explore the complex historical and contemporary relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. The course will also guide students to begin to understand the diversity and depth of Indigenous societies, worldviews, and knowledge through a multi-disciplinary lens.

Business for Artists
BUSN  99
Units/ Hours: 45
Through discussion, examples and practical application, this course introduces business practices that apply to visual artists. Sound business practices ensure that more time, money, and resources exist for artistic production. Knowing how to research and work with legal rights and responsibilities, financial structures, copyright, contractual obligations, ethics and negotiation skills is critical to survival and success. Through a combination of theory and practice, this course examines the ways in which artists can assess the market and price it appropriately.  Students will apply the processes required for responding to a call for submissions, commissions, and writing grant proposals in classroom activities, research and presentation.
Concept Development
ARTS 964
Units/ Hours: 120
This course is designed to provide the student with a focused and challenging studio experience paralleling professional practices. After beginning with intensive explorations in material investigations, they will negotiate their choice of material process with the faculty team and undertake the development and presentation of one or more series of works. Exercising self-reflective skills through a maintained exhibition space and ongoing review, the students will identify the beginnings and ongoing development of personal themes in their studio work. The progressive nature of the studio process will be emphasized through individual and group discussions with faculty. Cultural, political and social relevance in relation to personal interests will be referenced to the developing body of work in both historical and contemporary perspectives. This endeavor will culminate in an artists talk supported by a final exhibition of works.
