Program Highlights
Learn how to support, encourage and promote a young child’s growth and development through observation and implementation of creative play based learning experiences.
At Fleming College, Early Childhood Education students have unique opportunities to engage in active classroom learning environments that equip students with the skills and knowledge required to work with children (birth to 12 years).
All courses are based on a philosophy that encourages inclusive practices and partnerships with families. An emphasis is placed on applying what’s learned in the classroom to real–world settings, preparing students to start their careers as early childhood educators.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
Why Choose Fleming
A smaller program size means more individual attention in the classroom and customized field placements.
The program is designed to provide varied and extensive applied learning opportunities -from courses like Interactive Learning with Children and Families and Early Learning Practicums in semesters two, three and four. An interactive online course and a teamwork project “Creating Your Own Childcare” in the final semester consolidates and concludes your ECE learning.
Fleming offers support services to assist students in the further development of fundamental life and learning skills important to successfully complete the program. These skills include being able to work independently, participate in a team, organizational abilities, taking initiative and developing good work habits.
Work Placement
In semesters two and four you'll put theoretical education to work in a child care environment. In semester three, ECE teams will implement and run an Interactive Children’s Program, overseen by ECE faculty in the Peterborough community. This will prepare you for semester four, when you will be pulling it all together in your final block field placements.
A background working with young children (ages newborn to 12) in licensed child care centres is strongly recommended as a prerequisite for field placement.
Is this You?
To succeed in this program and in an ECE career, you need:
Good communication skills (both verbal and written)
Experience working with young children
Well-adjusted, grounded personality
A good sense of humour and imagination
Patience
Empathy
Creativity
Career Opportunities
There is an extremely high rate of related employment for graduates. As an Early Childhood Educator you will find work in child care centers, nursery schools, home day care programs, before and after school programs, early learning and parenting centers, resource services and Full Day Early Learning Kindergarten classrooms. Possibilities that are more exotic include children’s programming at resorts or on cruise ships. Graduates are also qualified to become owner/operators of child care centers.
Provincial Registration
In order to practice in Ontario as an Early Childhood Educator, graduates must apply for registration in the College of Early Childhood Educators (CECE). Graduates of Fleming College will meet the education requirements for registration. For more information please visit
www.college-ece.ca
Eco-Mentorship Certificate
The Eco-Mentorship Certificate is an innovative collaboration between Camp Kawartha and Fleming’s Early Childhood Education program that supports fostering a generation of people committed to the stewardship of the planet . A key focus of the work ECE students will be doing during their fourth-semester placement is inspiring children to learn about - and care for - their local environment. This will be done through discovering and respecting the deep ties that connect all living things on the planet. Students will observe children and find innovative ways to connect them to the natural world through an inquiry-based model of learning. They will be encouraged to integrate indigenous ways of knowing and learning into their experiential experiences with children. In addition to the required field placement curricula planning, students will aspire to create a sense of awe and wonder for children as they integrate outdoor and nature-based activities into their field work.
