Electricity I (ELCT  84)
Embedded Systems
COMP  37
Units/ Hours: 45
An embedded control system is a self-contained computer system that works in real time to control devices such as motors, appliances, instrumentation, robots, cell phones, and others.  This course introduces students to embedded interfacing by working with a microcontroller development board and integrated development environment.  Students learn how to develop, modify and troubleshoot embedded software and create interfacing systems for basic input/output operations.  The students will also learn how to connect the microcontroller to the Internet and develop a web interface to control devices connected to the microcontroller, remotely and display data collected by the microcontroller, in real time.

Programming in C++
COMP  80
Units/ Hours: 45
In this course, students will learn to implement, build, test, and debug programs written in the C++ programming language.  The course begins with a discussion of the essential elements of procedural programming - variables, data types, expressions, branches, loops, functions, and pointers - and then covers the basics of object-oriented programming - classes, objects and inheritance. Practical lab activities are performed in a Windows environment using Visual Studio.
Pre-Requisites
Scripting Fundamentals (COMP  86)
General Education Elective
Units/ Hours: 45
All graduates of diploma programs
require general education credits
. These courses allow you to explore issues of societal concern by looking at the history, theory and contemporary applications of those issues.
Your program has designated some required general education courses. In addition, you have the opportunity to
choose from a list of electives
each semester.
Many of these courses and some other general education courses are also available through evening classes, by distance education, or on-line. See our Part-Time Studies Calendar for these opportunities.
You may already possess general education equivalencies from other colleges or universities. Please see the General Education Co-ordinators at the Peterborough and Lindsay locations for possible exemptions.
Semester 4
Delivery: In Person
Applied Projects for CTN
APST 194
Units/ Hours: 60
This course allows the student to apply their experiential learning by utilizing their project management skills, computing and engineering skills to complete a project that demonstrate their abilities and allow them to showcase their abilities and serve the community by completing projects for local and surrounding area projects.
Pre-Requisites
Agile Project Management (COMP 596)
Cloud Computing Provisioning
COMP 595
Units/ Hours: 45
With networks speeds increasing and business needs ever-changing, cloud computing has established itself as the next frontier of modern computers. Due to the remote and flexible environment of cloud computing, a tailored approach to its security is necessary. This course introduces students to the concepts, practices, and logistics of cloud computing and cloud security. Students will manage and maintain cloud operating system configurations, access control, and virtualization through experiential learning exercises. As a result, students will have a strong understanding of cloud computing and the security considerations, preparing them for in-demand certifications and their future careers.
Pre-Requisites
Operating Systems II (COMP  75)
Database Applications
COMP 626
Units/ Hours: 45
Databases are an essential part of today's IT infrastructure, providing a flexible and scalable means for data to be efficiently stored and retrieved. Databases are not without their flaws, however, with poor implementations of them being vulnerable to injection and poisoning attacks. In this course, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of industry-standard database applications, their common vulnerabilities, and how to securely implement them in a business/IT environment. Students will leave the course with the skills to overcome database implementation challenges and the experience to properly utilize these applications during their careers.
Pre-Requisites
Scripting Applications (COMP 593)
Embedded Systems Integration
COMP 597
Units/ Hours: 45
Today's explosion of the machine to machine, embedded and internet of things worlds are spreading to all sectors of the market from healthcare to technology and everything between. This course will introduce the students to various aspects of modern communication between those intelligent embedded devices and the end-user through cloud-based system wireless or wired systems. This course will present the students the concept of system integration, with inter-operability and secure embedded system data exchange.
