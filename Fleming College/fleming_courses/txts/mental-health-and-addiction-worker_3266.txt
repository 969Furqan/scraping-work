4 semesters
Fleming College's Mental Health and Addiction program is aligned to the most recent competencies established for the field of addictions and mental health. In 2014, Competencies for Canada's Substance Abuse Workforce were introduced to establish the different levels of competencies required to work in the field of addictions (CCSA, 2014). In 2015, the Mental Health Commission of Canada introduced Guidelines for Recovery-Oriented Practice to guide competencies required to work in the field of mental health (MHCC, 2015).
Program Highlights
During the first semester of your educational journey, you will be introduced to the field with courses in Human Service, Power Privilege and Oppression, Counselling Interventions I, and Mental Health and Recovery. You will also learn about Indigenous Studies.
In your second semester you will build on the knowledge gained in first semester to learn much more about substance use and mental health. Courses focus on the Understanding Substance Use, Screening and Assessment, Case Management and Service Coordination, Prevention and Health Promotion, Counselling Interventions II and Ethics and Professional Practice.
Third semester helps you explore Trauma Specific Treatment Interventions, Family and Social Support, Understanding Concurrent Disorders, Building Capacity in Communities, Counselling Interventions III and Professional Practice.
The fourth and final semester integrates what you have learned in the classroom over the previous three semesters during a professional field placement experience. Field placement learning can take place anywhere in the province, or across Canada. Students will also complete and online Psychopharmacology course while on field placement.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
Is this for you?
Graduates of the Mental Health and Addiction program will:
Gain the skills to work in a variety of settings supporting clients, families, groups and communities affected by substance use and mental health issues.

Understand how to apply evidence - based knowledge and skills in screening, assessment, treatment planning and interventions that promote equitable access to supports and services.
Learn the application of harm reduction strategies, trauma informed interventions, case management, health promotion, and prevention.

Success Stories
My experience during this program was fantastic. It was worth every minute. My goal of making a career change into this field worked like a dream for me. When I graduated, I was prepared, because of what I learned at Fleming College. If I had a choice of any job, this is the one I would choose.
Rick Mayoh, Trauma and Addictions Counsellor
Why Choose Fleming
Fleming's Mental Health and Addiction program offers a unique applied learning experience which enables graduates to work in various areas within the field of mental health and addictions. Students can choose to build on their program of study in Mental Health and Addictions by completing the Social Service Worker dual diploma, or pursue a degree with advanced standing at a university through one of our many transfer agreements.
The program's flexible delivery structure features entry points in the fall, winter, and spring with all four intakes running every semester. This meets the needs of diverse student groups including:
Students who require or wish a reduced course load
Students who want to complete the program faster can attend four continuous semesters and graduate in sixteen months.
Winter intake, first semester students take second semester in the spring, third semester in the fall, and fourth semester in the winter. Spring first semester intake takes semester two in the fall, the third semester in the winter, and the fourth semester in the spring. Students starting in September complete the second semester in the Winter, the third semester in the Fall, and the forth semester in the Winter and take the summer semester off.
Individuals receiving funding that is dependent on attending classes continuously without semester breaks would start in the Winter or Spring semesters.
Earn a Dual Diploma in the Helping Professions
Students now have the opportunity to complete two college diplomas - Mental Health and Addiction and
Social Service Worker
- within a two-year period. This pathway includes two field placement opportunities where students acquire additional hands-on experience to further prepare them for career success. Students have the option of entering into either program, and after completing their first semester can declare their intention to complete either one diploma in Social Service Work, one diploma in Mental Health and Addiction, or both diplomas.
The dual diploma pathway is available to students who enter in the fall or winter semester only. Students must attend school for six consecutive semesters to complete both diplomas. Students ​who start ​in the Mental Health and Addiction ​Worker ​program in first semester will complete their Social Service Worker field placement first in fifth semester and complete their Mental ​Health and Addictions ​Worker field placement in the sixth semester.
