Program Highlights
In this challenging two-year diploma program, students will learn to use computer technologies to capture and analyze data, for use in patient care, decision support, funding and planning. Health records are the primary source of information used by hospitals and health care facilities to code services for reimbursement purposes. This information is also needed by public health officials to indicate disease patterns and trends, and by medical researchers for analysis, comparison and decision support.
Health service careers are among the fastest growing occupations in the economy. In the healthcare field, this really is the information age. There's a whole new growth market for the skills and training of health information management and health records professionals. An aging population and increasing health care needs, combined with the focus on accountability, efficiency and effectiveness of health care services delivery, has led to a skills shortage. You will graduate equipped with very marketable skills in the health information management sector. Some of those skills will include expertise in the following areas:
data quality
data collection and coding
record /systems management
privacy, confidentiality and security of health information
transitioning to the electronic health record
This program is accredited by the Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA).
The Canadian College of Health Information Management sets the accreditation standards for educational institutions offering health information programs in Canada.
Accreditation demonstrates to the public that a program is aligned to industry standards, as identified through the College’s needs assessment and consultation with industry. It is a voluntary, self-regulatory process to recognize those that meet or exceed the standards set for health information education. The purpose of accrediting programs is to ensure continuous quality improvement of the educational content to support the evolving health information industry.
Graduates are eligible to write the National Certification Examination of the Canadian College of Health Information Management. To learn more about the Health Information Management profession and the certification exam, please visit

Success Stories
"This program combines my love of technology with my knowledge of health sciences. You can’t make decisions in the best interest of patient care and the hospital without Health Information Management. This program really prepared me for a rewarding and challenging career. The instructors were either currently working in the field or had worked in it, so they gave us first-hand knowledge of the real world. The dedicated computer lab for our program was always open for us to practice. And my placements helped me practice what I learned in the lab. I was able to see, how a hospital flows and how it all comes together. If you have an interest in healthcare but don’t want to be on the front lines, this is an amazing way to contribute to make the system better. Everything we learned in the program I use every single day. "

Why Choose Fleming
Fleming College has a reputation as a leader in technology-based learning. The HIM program at Fleming follows this trend with a vision of "Inspiring innovative students to become innovative leaders in HIM through applied learning." One of our mission statements is to "Espouse the state of the art in Health Information Management." We demonstrate this through our brand-new, fully-computerized lab with over 500 anonymized patient records and scanning equipment, to provide students with practical application knowledge that supports the move in healthcare to electronic health records (EHRs). A real-world populated database of patient information allows the learner to run realistic reports to support the needs of users for decision-making purposes.
Through its previous successful practicums, the HIM program has developed excellent relationships with numerous healthcare facilities throughout the region and beyond, resulting in good practicum and employment opportunities for graduates.
Work Experience
The program includes a strong practical component. Students will participate in two work placement experiences, a total of eight weeks in all. Students spend two weeks in a workplace setting in semester two, and four weeks in a workplace setting in semester four. Practicum components will not necessarily be in the immediate Peterborough area. Practicum agencies may require proof of immunization and a criminal records check (vulnerable sector).
Is this You?
This challenging and rigorous program is for those who are interested in a career where healthcare meets the cutting edge of technology. The following attributes and skills are assets for this program and career path:
ability/willingness to work as part of a team and independently
self-motivated
dedicated to lifelong learning
organized, with excellent judgment
analytical, detail-oriented
customer support oriented
minimum keyboarding speed of 30 words per minute
It is strongly recommended that students possess basic Microsoft Office Suite skills (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Internet Explorer) for research, report writing and presentations.
Career Opportunities
Graduates will be qualified for employment in a variety of health service settings and can choose the area that most interests them, including hospitals, chronic and long-term care facilities, community healthcare, mental health agencies, rehabilitation services, private clinics, health information networks, insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and government agencies and services. Your job titles could include:
Health Record/Information Technician
Coding Specialist
Release of Information Specialist
Health Record/Information Administrator
Data Analyst
Data Quality Specialist
Starting salaries per year are in the $50,000 to $55,000 range. The recently released "Health Informatics and Health Information Management Human Resources Report" confirms the increasing demand for qualified Health Informatics (HI) and Health Information Management professionals, and projects significant labour and skills shortages in this field in the near future.
