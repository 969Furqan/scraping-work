Program Highlights
Our six-semester program focuses on industrial electrical power, process controls, and automation systems, however the program content and skills can also be applied to commercial and residential settings. There is a high degree of practical lab work within the program using modern industrial equipment and software to ensure students gain the technical knowledge and experience needed for industry.
Extensive hands-on training and applied learning through labs, an applied project course, and an optional co-op provide students with the practical experience they need to succeed in the workplace.
With a focus on safety, students are trained in industry health and safety standards and regulations such as:
Canadian Electrical Code
Occupational Health and Safety Act
CSA Electrical Safety Standard
WHMIS
Working at Heights
Confined Space Identification
Hoisting and Rigging
Students who have completed the four-semester Electrical Engineering Technician program will have a pathway into the third year of the Electrical Engineering Technology program.
Why Choose Fleming
Our lab facilities are equipped with the latest technology and tools. We offer small lab section sizes and, whenever possible, each student has their own workstation and set of equipment to work with to provide individual training.
