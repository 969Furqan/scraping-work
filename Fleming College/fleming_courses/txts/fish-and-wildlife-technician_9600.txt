Program Highlights
Fish and wildlife management is an important aspect of modern society as it helps to conserve and maintain healthy populations of fish and wildlife, their habitats, and biodiversity. Effective management practices ensure the long-term sustainability of these resources and help mitigate the impacts of human activities such as overfishing, hunting, and habitat destruction. By understanding the interrelationships between species, habitats, and human activities, wildlife managers can make informed decisions about how to conserve and manage these resources. This is especially important as the world's growing human population continues to put increasing pressure on wildlife and their habitats. Through fish and wildlife management, we can protect important ecosystem services, conserve biodiversity, and ensure that future generations have the opportunity to enjoy and benefit from these resources.
The theory and skills required by fish and wildlife professionals are taught through applied learning activities with a significant amount of time doing hands-on work in the lab and field.
Third-semester students spend five weeks in field school, focusing on the topics of fisheries, wildlife, terrestrial habitats, wetlands, and freshwater ecology. These field schools introduce new skills such as: boat handling, GPS navigation, fish netting, sampling and tagging, electrofishing, habitat assessment, wetland classification, bird banding, and use of wildlife monitoring technologies. Through these activities, students will work together to collect, analyze and present the data over the remainder of the technician-level education and training.
During field excursions you will learn about the logistics involved in the design and implementation of field projects.
You will also spend considerable time in the outdoors learning mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish and plant identification skills, tracking animals and conducting wildlife surveys.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.
Optional Co-op
Students entering the program in September may apply to participate in an optional paid co-op. The deadline to apply is at the end of November, where students must submit an Application Form (including a resume) to the Co-op Office. Students must achieve a 70% (2.5 GPA) average, and pass all courses in Semester 1 in order to be enrolled in the Co-op Option. Students who are accepted will participate in a Career Preparation course, and will do their co-op between semesters 2 and 3. The Co-op Option provides the opportunity to:
Integrate classroom learning with work-based learning
Explore the variety of careers available in the field
Network for future job opportunities
The Co-op Option is not available for students who begin the program in January, as they attend classes over the summer.
Please note:
In addition to paying tuition and fees for 4 semesters of study, students participating in the co-op pay a co-op fee (approximately $558.00) for administrative costs associated with the co-op placement.

Recent graduates have found employment with agencies of the federal, provincial and municipal governments, the private sector, non-government organizations (NGO’s) and academia. Recent government employers include the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Ministry of the Environment Conservation and Parks, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Environment Canada and many Conservation Authorities. There are many private sector positions with organizations such as Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, Birds Canada, Nature Conservancy of Canada, Delta Waterfowl and Ducks Unlimited. There are also opportunities to work with private environmental consultants who provide assessments inventories and surveys of wildlife and habitat for industry and the government.
In 2017, Eco Canada published a report on careers in fish and wildlife, stating: "The current political environment is driving a positive outlook for FW careers because governments are looking to improve fisheries and wildlife management, conservation, and protection. In addition, the use of technology is reshaping the sub-sector. These, and other factors, will maintain demand for FW skills and knowledge. The FW sub-sector is expected to continue grow at a steady rate until 2024, creating a stable, vibrant, and diverse future for core FW workers."
