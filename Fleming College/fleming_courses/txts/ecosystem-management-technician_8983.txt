Program Highlights
Fleming's Ecosystem Management Technician program highlights a holistic approach to the management of human activity within ecosystems. We will prepare you for an exciting career that can take you where you want to go, either in your home community, in a wilderness environment, or across the globe. Through careful consideration of the needs of society and the environment, you'll help governments, conservation groups, and wildlife organizations undertake environmentally sustainable planning for the future.
Within the program, you'll study ecosystem composition, structure and function in wilderness, rural, and urban landscapes, and acquire a broad range of technical skills, as well as the flexibility to adapt to changing job requirements. As well, you will:
learn the principles of experimental design and research, and how to apply them to a project of your own
participate in the monitoring and assessment of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, conduct resource inventories and environmental sampling, and develop plans for the management of public and private landscapes
conduct field research in partnership with a variety of organizations and analyze data generated by this work
learn to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to analyze ecosystems at a variety of scales.
* Students starting in January are required to attend classes over the summer semester.

Work Experience
The Ecosystem Management Program provides the student with a two-week (80 hour) mandatory field placement. This placement is designed to allow you to apply your skills, demonstrate your abilities and obtain valuable work experience that many employers are looking for.
The program also has three organized placements: two international placements in South Africa and one in Costa Rica, which enable students to gain a global perspective on conservation. Students who participate in these organized placement experiences are selected based on a rigorous screening process.
Common First Semester
Students in our School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences diploma programs take the same core courses in first semester. This common focus exposes you to a variety of career options – and other programs. You will have the freedom to explore and obtain a multidisciplinary perspective, while you acquire a base of knowledge and fundamental skills.
Although students are accepted into a specific program for their first semester, the common first semester allows you to change direction if your find another program or career area is a better fit with your goals and interests. Once you have successfully completed the common first semester, you can enter the program of your choice in second semester, subject to enrolment capacity.
Is this You?

the ability to ask questions, solve problems and create sustainable plans
an interest in understanding how ecosystems and humanity interact
analytical and creative thinking
excellent oral and written communication skills
the ability to work as part of a team
good organizational ability
cultural awareness/sensitivity
excellent interpersonal skills

Career Opportunities
As a Technician, you'll find work in careers such as:
resource management technician
urban forest management
geomatics technician
aquatic/terrestrial biologist
environmental education
land use planning
restoration technician
watershed technician
environmental consultant, and others.
You'll work for conservation authorities, parks departments, private consulting firms, municipal/provincial/federal governments, non-governmental organizations, First Nations communities, or stewardship organizations. Positions can be found across Canada and around the world.
