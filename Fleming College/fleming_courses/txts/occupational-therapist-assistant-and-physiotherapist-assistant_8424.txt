Program Highlights
With ever-increasing numbers of aging people requiring assistance to continue a full life, the need has never been greater for occupational therapists(OTs), physiotherapists (PTs) and their assistants. While a great deal of work these days is with seniors, there's also much to be done with those recovering from surgery, health conditions such as cancer or stroke, and chronic conditions such as arthritis. You can help people get back into their lives - as an Occupational Therapist Assistant and Physiotherapist Assistant.
As an OTA and PTA, you'll help awaken people's physical potential - and learn more about yourself in the process. Throughout the deliberately broad-based four-semester program, you'll learn how to assist clients to achieve their health goals.
Rather than focus your studies exclusively on the occupational therapy
or
physical therapy streams, you will develop the ability to work with both professions.
The Occupational Therapist Assistant and Physiotherapist Assistant Program at Fleming College has been accredited by the Occupational Therapist Assistant and Physiotherapist Assistant Education Accreditation Program (OTA & PTA EAP) in collaboration with Physiotherapy Education Accreditation Canada (PEAC) and the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT). The status of Accreditation was awarded to the program on April 30, 2020 for the period until April 30, 2026.
