Program Highlights
You will transform hot, molten glass into breathtaking works of art. Courses in design, colour, drawing and art history will provide you with a strong foundation for the varied glassblowing methodologies explored in the studio. They include cold working techniques, colour applications, mould-making and production.
The large airy studio can easily accommodate the four workstations it houses. Each is equipped with a bench, marver, glory hole, hand tools and pipes necessary for you to manipulate the molten glass contained in the two 200 lb free-standing pot furnaces. The studio was completely rebuilt in 2013 and offers state-of-the-art equipment with ample annealer space for students to work comfortably. Complimenting the hot shop is a fully equipped cold shop with all the tools that you need to enhance and complete your work. You will have access to a diamond saw and sandblaster.
Equivalent to two semesters of full-time study, our intensive 15-week certificate programs provide over 600 hours of hands-on studio time. Each week you will work alongside a different faculty member who brings their unique perspective and expertise within the discipline to the studio. Limited enrolment ensures you have access to equipment and time to interact with faculty. You will also benefit from the guidance of experienced studio technicians and extended hours in the studio after class.
