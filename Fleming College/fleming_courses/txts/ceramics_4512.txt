This course will engage the student in basic drawing processes as they relate to the art of ceramic design and description. Using line, value, texture, colour and proportion students will focus on concept sketches, working drawings and presentation renderings. Basic colouring techniques and colour theory will be applied during the creative design process, while exploring personal style, in a series of clay works. Students will use journals to gather research material and concepts.
Firing Techniques
ARTS1654
Units/ Hours: 18
In this course, students will be introduced to a range of bisque and glaze firing processes using an electric kiln. The proper use of kilns with respect to loading and unloading, firing, firing control, maintenance, cleaning and minor repairs will be covered. Health and safety issues are an integral part of all aspects of kiln firing ceramics and will be addressed as an ongoing part of this course.
Glaze Science
ARTS1653
Units/ Hours: 30
In this course students will be introduced to the science of glazes by mixing basic glaze formulas. Examples will be presented to demonstrate that glazes can be designed and adjusted. 
 
The characteristics and choice of raw materials and their roles will also be demonstrated. As the chemical properties and mechanical properties of glaze materials can be extremely hazardous, ongoing information will be presented during this course to maintain the highest possible standards in health and safety practices.
Marketing/Portfolio Development
MKTG  53
Units/ Hours: 48
Practicing artists can choose from many different paths to advance their personal and artistic goals in artistic practice, education, presentation skills and promotion and marketing as entrepreneurs. Each student will establish their own specific focus for continuing their artist's practice. In class sessions will involve online research, writing, digital photography, presentation and critical discussion. Pre-course assignment work will provide the data for artist documents and digital images of their work for the development of a portfolio. Students will show their work in an established campus venue as a culmination to their certificate program experience. Certificate students who have already completed the first two semesters of the Visual and Creative Arts Diploma Program will complete this course mainly as independent review and revision of their portfolio and artists documents in collaboration with faculty.
