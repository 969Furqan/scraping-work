Program Highlights
This compressed, one-year program is the only Aquaculture program offered as a Post-Graduate Certificate in Ontario. Food aquaculture operations encompass a wide variety of species and culture techniques. In addition to food production, aquaculture activities include production of fish for conservation, and production for ornamental species. The global demand for aquaculture products is growing, along with demands for stewardship, sustainability and food safety and security. This unique program combines:
Significant hands-on operational experience
Numerous field trips to experience aspects of the aquaculture industry such as trout farming and conservation stocking
Business training so that graduates can both promote the industry and understand the diverse challenges facing aquaculture enterprises
During first semester, students will address aquaculture fundamentals. Much of the program will take place in the campus hatchery facilities, which include an Atlantic salmon hatchery and a muskellunge hatchery.
The focus in second semester is on operational and business practices, and internship planning.
Co-op Experience
Final semester is an 8-week, off-site, paid co-op experience, enabling students to specialize in their area of interest.
Please note:
In addition to paying tuition and fees for 2 semesters of study, students pay a co-op fee (approximately $558.00) for administrative costs associated with the co-op placement.
Career Opportunities
The industry is growing in all sectors, including food production, conservation, aquaponics and pond/garden markets. The work is physically demanding and may involve exposure to unfavourable weather conditions. Graduates should be prepared to relocate for employment, and to undertake entry level or contract work initially. With an aging workforce, those who possess strong leadership and communication skills, plus aptitude for mechanical troubleshooting, are prime candidates for promotion into lead hand or supervisory roles.
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production activity in the world (UN Food and Agriculture Organization)
Canada is the 4th largest salmon producing country)
Canadian aquaculture accounts for 14% of total seafood production and 35% of its value
Learning Outcomes
Perform a variety of aquaculture field skills competently, in accordance with established norms, and in a way that provides leadership and direction for others where required.
Assess environmental aspects of aquaculture and communicate the results to a variety of stakeholders using current and relevant terminology.
Recognize and justify the diversity and potential for aquaculture as alternative source of fish protein.
Monitor and assess fish health and environmental conditions at an aquaculture site.
Describe and distinguish all life stages and culture techniques of select marine and freshwater species.
Examine and evaluate the business viability and potential for various aquaculture operations.
Assess the economic and social viability of specific aquaculture technologies and design.
Lead and maintain a variety of aquaculture operations, employing the appropriate mechanical and technical skills as required.
Supervise and evaluate aquaculture field crews in accordance with established protocols.
Minimum Admission Requirements
Students applying to Aquaculture (Co-op) must meet the following requirements:
Undergraduate degree or Ontario College diploma in a related field or equivalent
As aquaculture deals with large bodies of water, students must be comfortable in, on and around water. Field skills in 2nd semester requires students to demonstrate basic swimming skills in a supervised pool session.

After the principles and practice of these skills are demonstrated by the professor, students will practice these skills in the salmonid hatchery under the guidance of technicians.
Mechanical Systems in Aquaculture
MECH 233
Units/ Hours: 45
Through weekly lectures and seminars, students will become familiar with the design, operation and maintenance of a variety of production systems used in extensive and intensive aquaculture sectors including pond, flow-through, recirculation and cage systems.  By examining 'what if' scenarios, emergency response procedures will be analyzed and practiced.  Students will research, document and compare a mechanical system used in the aquaculture industry and present their findings in a seminar and written report.
Trout and Salmon Farming Field Trips and Workshops I
APST 120
Units/ Hours: 45
During the first semester the student will take a 5 day tour of the rainbow trout cage farming industry in Lake Huron.  At field locations and evening sessions, industry representatives will share their knowledge and experience of the trout and salmon farming industry.  At some sites students will get the opportunity to practice net cage skills such as feeding and net changing.
Semester 2
Delivery: In Person
Aqua Certifications & Welfare
FIWI  88
Units/ Hours: 30
This course introduces students to the relevant provincial and federal legislation regarding an aquaculture operation. Students will be introduced to legislation that is relevant to Indigenous communities in Canada. In addition, third party certifications such as Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP), Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) will be explored. In addition this course will give students an insight to Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) and the new Code of Practice for Farmed Salmonids (COP) regulations/policies and how fish and the aquaculture industry are represented in those policies. Proper welfare related operational procedures will be discussed.
