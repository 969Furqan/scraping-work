Culinary Sustainability - MINOR
For students and chefs who want to make a difference and be a part of the sustainability movement, the
Culinary Sustainability minor is designed for them. In this area of study, students explore their local food web to meet food growers, producers and fishermen/women to learn about food system issues such as human effects on ecological systems, climate change, energy usage, animal welfare, growing conditions, the environment and society. In the kitchen, students consider solutions to these issues as they design, purchase and produce sustainably driven menus and artisan products at a high level. In the community, they learn about impacts on food policy while implementing strategic plans for organizations. Skills and concepts learned in this minor afford students the tools needed to become change agents in an industry in need of transformation.
