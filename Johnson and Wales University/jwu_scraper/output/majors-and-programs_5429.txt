JWU’s English as a Second Language (ESL) program provides international students with an opportunity to learn English for academic purposes through intensive English instruction and weekly enhancement activities. The ESL program is offered at both the undergraduate and graduate levels at JWU’s Providence campus.
This intensive program focuses on English language for academic purposes — the language and communication skills critical to success in American university settings. Following an assessment, students are placed in courses at their specific level of English proficiency, targeting the skills to bring them to the next level of academic readiness.
All four domains of language — listening, speaking, reading, and writing — are addressed through engaging lessons and activities both inside and outside of the classroom. Instruction goes beyond lectures to promote interaction and prepare students for educational practices common to American higher education, including:
discussions
group work
presentations
integrated technology (blended learning)
project-based learning
Weekly enrichment activities expose students to various facets of university life and prepare them for admission to undergraduate and graduate degree programs.
