Program Overview
JWU’s Pre-MBA program is designed for outstanding international students who have completed a 3-year non-business-focused bachelor’s degree at an accredited institution but may need additional credits to equate to a 4-year degree.
Course Requirements
This program requires that a minimum of 10 undergraduate courses be taken at JWU.
Course substitutions of higher-level subjects and electives in a comparable discipline may be approved based on previous study, but no exemptions will be made which result in a reduced number of required courses.
Eligibility
Applicants to the Pre-MBA program must hold a 3-year degree from a recognized undergraduate-level institution with a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.
Students who have successfully completed the Pre-MBA program with a GPA of 3.0 on a scale of 4.0 will enroll directly into their selected MBA program.
