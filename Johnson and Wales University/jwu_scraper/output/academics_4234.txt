Pre-Health Advising
Pre-Health Advising is available to current students who are anticipating entering into professional health-related careers and post-baccalaureate programs (including those offered by JWU).
We are currently in the process of overhauling our pre-health advising content; in the interim, you can reach out to Associate Dean Rebecca Simon
by email
with questions.
