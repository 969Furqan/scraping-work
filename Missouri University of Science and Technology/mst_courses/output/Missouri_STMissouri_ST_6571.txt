About the Certificate
Change and growth in Missouri and America require the training and nourishing of entrepreneurs. Many individuals, however, do not yet recognize the entrepreneurial spirit in themselves. While you may not be sure if you have what it takes to drive innovation, recent entrepreneurship research indicates that many of the skills and much of the knowledge of successful entrepreneurs can be developed and taught in the classroom.
The graduate certicate in Entrepreneurship and Technological Innovation will help spark your entrepreneurial spirit and provide a solid foundation on which to build your skills and knowledge. To that end, the program focuses on the following competencies:
Recognizing opportunity
Fostering innovations
Leveraging resources
Design thinking
Assessing opportunity
Mastering creativity
Mitigating and managing risk
Implementing new ideas
Planning under uncertainty
Building and managing networks
Focus and adaptability
Admission requirements
The graduate certificate program is open to all individuals holding a bachelor’s, master’s or doctorate degree in areas such as business, social sciences, technology, engineering, or related disciplines.
In order to receive a graduate certificate, the student must have an average GPA of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale in the certificate courses taken. Students admitted only to the certificate program will have non-degree graduate status, but will earn graduate credit for the courses they complete.
If the four-course sequence approved by the graduate advisor is completed with a grade of B or better in each of the courses taken, the student will, upon application, be admitted to the master of business administration or to the master of science in information science and technology. The certificate courses taken by students admitted to the program will count toward their degree program.
Once admitted to the certificate program, a student will be given three years to complete the program as long as a B or better average is maintained in the courses taken.
