About the Certificate
The control systems graduate certificate program is designed for working engineers to enhance their knowledge and provide current information on technological changes in the area of control systems. Earning a graduate certificate not only provides the opportunity to strengthen your academic background, but also serves as a pathway for pursuing a master's degree in aerospace engineering or mechanical engineering at Missouri S&T.
