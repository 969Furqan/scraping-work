Master of Science in Technical Communication
The Department of English and Technical Communication offers both an on-campus (traditional) and online Master of Science in Technical Communication.
Traditional
Most of your courses will be traditional "classroom" courses that require you, your classmates and your teacher to come to campus at specified times and meet for lectures, discussions and other activities. Some of your courses, however, will be completely online. We believe that a technical communication student needs to learn how to function successfully in online environments.
Online
If you choose this option, all of your courses will be either online synchronous (with live meetings in Zoom) or online asynchronous (with recorded lectures and submission of work on Canvas). On rare occasions, you may have to come to campus for degree-related business, although, if necessary, we can usually find ways around a campus visit.
Degree requirements
This MS degree has a non-thesis option (at least 30 credit hours) and a thesis option (at least 33 credit hours).
