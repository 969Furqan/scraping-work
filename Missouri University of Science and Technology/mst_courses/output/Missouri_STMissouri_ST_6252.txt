About the Certificate
This certificate program is designed to provide graduate students with formalized education in the area of geologic hazards assessment and engineering. This certificate requires two courses which provide a background in geological engineering and geology and geotechnics and allows students to pick two additional courses among a variety of hazard- and detection-oriented civil and geological engineering offerings.
Curriculum:
The following course is required:
GEO ENG 5441 Engineering Geology and Geotechnics
Choose one course from the following:
GEO ENG 6441 Geotechnical Construction Pratice
GEO ENG 6625 Application in Geological Engineering
Choose two courses from the following:
GEO ENG 5144 Remote Snsing Technology
GEO ENG 5146 Applications of Geographic Information Systems
CIV ENG 5337 River Mechanics and Sediment Transport
GEO ENG 5471 Rock Engineering
CIV ENG 5716 Geotechinical Earthquake Engineering
GEO ENG 5782 Environmental and Engineering Geophysics –or– GEO ENG 5761 Transportation Applications of Geophysics
GEO ENG 6146 Advanced Remote Sensing and Image Processing
CIV ENG 6205 Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering
GEO ENG 6477 Discontinuous Rock
CIV ENG 6717 Earth Dams and Related Problems
Curriculum is subject to change. Other courses approved by the program coordinator may be substituted for any of the above listed courses on a case-by-case basis.
Admission requirements
The graduate certificate program
is open to all persons holding a B.S
.
, M
.
S., or Ph.D. degree in geology, geophysics, geological engineering, geotechnics, or civil engineering or who are currently accepted into a graduate degree program in one of these fields at Missouri S&T. Once admitted to the program, the student must take the four designated courses (provided in the curriculum section). In order to receive a graduate certificate, the student must have an average cumulative grade point of 3.0 or better in the certificate courses. Once admitted to the program, a student will be given three years to complete the program.
Students admitted into the certificate program will have non-degree graduate status, however, they will earn graduate credit for the courses they complete. If the student completes the four-course sequence with a grade of B or better in each of the courses taken, they, upon application, will be admitted to their choice of non-thesis M.S. degree programs in either geological engineering or geotechnics
.
The certificate credits taken by the students admitted to the M.S. degree program will count towards their master's degree. Students who do not have all of the prerequisite courses necessary to begin the courses in the certificate program will be allowed to take ''bridge" courses at either the graduate or undergraduate level to prepare for the formal certificate courses.
Distance application requirements
Students applying for a graduate certificate must submit the following:
Completed Application
Statement of Purpose
Transcripts
Online Application
When you start a new application, select "Graduate Online/Distance" and then select the certificate program.
Don't forget to list your current employer and company location on the application.
Statement of purpose should be 2-3 paragraphs explaining why you are applying for this program.
Statement is to be submitted electronically on the
online application
; you'll copy and paste it into the provided text box.
Unofficial transcripts are sufficient for an admit decision.

online application
under your "Institutional Data." If you previously attended S&T, you must upload your transcript. An unofficial transcript can be requested through Joe’SS.
How to Request Unofficial Transcripts
(pdf)
PDF scans are preferred.
The university requires official transcripts from all schools attended before a student may register for a second semester.
In order for a transcript to be counted as official it must be sent directly from the school to S&T, it cannot come from a student.
Official transcripts should be mailed to Global Learning:
Missouri University of Science and Technology
Office of Global Learning

Pathway to a Master's Degree
Are you a working professional who wants to earn your master's degree, but you don’t have time to take the GRE/GMAT? Then start in a graduate certificate program. Graduate certificates were designed as a pathway to a master's degree.* The admission requirements are more relaxed and credit earned will count toward your degree. Once you successfully earn your graduate certificate, you can continue with the corresponding master's degree without having to take the GRE/GMAT.
Related Degrees
This graduate certificate may act as a pathway to the following master’s programs:
Geotechnics
(ME)
Geological Engineering
(MS)
*Completion of a graduate certificate program does not automatically guarantee admission into a corresponding graduate degree program. To continue in a master’s degree program, you must apply.
