Information Science and Technology
Undergraduate Degree
The bachelor of science in
information science and technology
(IST) is a STEM degree that will provide you with the necessary skills to connect management and technology in today’s workforce. Graduates in this field empower organizations by managing and supporting information systems to yield a more efficient and profitable enterprise.
There is great demand for IT professionals who have both strong technical knowledge and broad understanding of business. These individuals are needed to implement and manage technology that supports business processes, managerial decision-making and organizational communication. Although this is a computing-focused program, you’ll spend most of your day working with people, not machines. To this end, all IST majors are eligible to receive a minor in business without any additional coursework.
