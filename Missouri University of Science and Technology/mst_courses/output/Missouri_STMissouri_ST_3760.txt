About the Certificate
The graduate certificate in management and leadership provides students with the knowledge required to manage and lead technological enterprises.
Admission requirements
The graduate certificate program is open to all individuals holding a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree in areas such as business, social sciences, technology, engineering, or related disciplines.
In order to receive a graduate certificate, the student must have an average graduate cumulative grade point of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale in the certificate courses taken.
Students admitted only to the certificate program will have non-degree graduate status but will earn graduate credit for the courses they complete.
The courses in the certificate program are offered such that students can complete the program in a timely manner. If the four-course sequence approved by the graduate advisor is completed with a grade of B or better in each of the courses taken, the student will, upon application, be admitted to the master of business administration or to the master of science in information science and technology.  The certificate courses taken by students admitted to the program will count toward the graduate degree program.
Once admitted to the certificate program, a student will be given three years to complete the program as long as a B or better average is maintained in the courses taken.
