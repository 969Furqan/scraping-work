About the Certificate
This certificate program is designed to provide formalized education in the area of contemporary structural engineering.
As a student in the program, you have the option of taking courses that provide a more classical approach to the study of structural engineering and engineering mechanics. Courses in this certificate program cover analysis and design of structural systems.
Admission requirements
This certificate program is open to all individuals who hold a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree and who have a minimum of 12 months of post-bachelor's professional employment experience.
Once admitted to the program, you must take four designated courses. In order to receive a graduate certificate, you must have an average cumulative grade of 3.0 or better in the certificate courses.
Students admitted to the certificate program will have non-degree graduate status, but will earn graduate credit for the courses they complete.
If you complete the four-course sequence with a grade of B or better in each of the courses taken, you can enroll in the master's program, if you so choose. The certificate credits you've earned will count toward your master’s degree. If you do not have all of the prerequisite courses necessary to take the courses in the certificate program, you can take “bridge” courses at either the graduate or undergraduate level to prepare for the formal certificate courses.
Once admitted to the program, you are given three years to complete the program so long as you maintain a B average in the courses taken.
