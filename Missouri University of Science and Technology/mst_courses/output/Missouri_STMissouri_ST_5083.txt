About the Certificate
Managing the development of large software systems is significantly different from managing construction or research projects. However, some of the tools developed for traditional project management continue to have value and can be adapted to development of software.
This certificate is designed to equip students with a set of tools that will enable them to effectively manage the process of developing large software systems. At the same time, it exposes them to Project Management Institute (PMI) standards in the general project managment area.
Admission requirements
The information system project management certificate program is open to all persons holding a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree in areas such as business, social sciences, technology, engineering, or related disciplines.
The certificate program consists of four courses. Potential students must have the prerequisites for the courses in the program. In order to receive a graduate certificate, students must have an average graduate cumulative grade point (GPA) of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale in the certificate courses taken.
Students admitted only to the certificate program will have non-degree graduate status, but will earn graduate credit for the courses they complete.
The courses in the program will be offered at least once per year. If the four-course sequence approved by the graduate advisor is completed with a grade of B or better in each of the courses taken, the student will, upon application, be admitted to the master of business administration (MBA) or the master of science in information science and technology (MS IST). The certificate courses taken by students admitted to the certificate program will count toward the graduate degree program.
Once admitted to the certificate program, a student will be given three years to complete the program so long as a B or better average is maintained in the courses taken.
