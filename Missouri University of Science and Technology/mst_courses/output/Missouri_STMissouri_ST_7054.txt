About the Certificate
This certificate program is designed to provide formalized education in the area of explosives engineering. Students will be exposed to the theoretical and practical approaches of explosives engineering. Students will learn analysis and design of explosive-related systems and both natural and built structure effects.
Admission requirements
The explosives engineering certificate program is open to all persons holding a BS (in applied science, technology or engineering), MS, or PhD degree and who have a minimum of 12-months of post-BS professional employment experience.
Once admitted to the program, the student must take the four designated courses listed above. In order to receive a graduate certificate, the student must have an average cumulative grade of 3.0 or better in the certificate courses.
Students admitted to the certificate program will have non-matriculated status; however, if they complete the four-course sequence with a grade of B or better in each of the courses taken, they will be admitted to the MS explosives engineering program, upon application. The explosive engineering certificate credits taken by students admitted to the MS program will count toward their master's degree in explosives engineering.
Students who do not have all of the prerequisite courses necessary to take the courses in the certificate program will be allowed to take "bridge" courses at either the graduate or undergraduate level to prepare for the formal certificate courses.
Once admitted to a certificate program, a student will be given three years to complete the program, so long as he/she maintains at least a B average in the courses taken.

Pathway to a Master's Degree
Are you a working professional who wants to earn your master's degree, but you don’t have time to take the GRE/GMAT? Then start in a graduate certificate program. Graduate certificates were designed as a pathway to a master's degree.* The admission requirements are more relaxed and credit earned will count toward your degree. Once you successfully earn your graduate certificate, you can continue with the corresponding master's degree without having to take the GRE/GMAT.
