About the Certificate
The graduate certificate in Geophysics is designed to provide graduate students who want to emphasize this area of research with course guidance and a formal recognition.  A certificate in Geophysics will give students an advantage when applying for careers in oil and gas, mining, and other fields. The certificate requires that students take four graduate-level geophysics courses.
Admission requirements
The Geophysics Certificate Program is open to all persons holding a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. degree in Geology, Geophysics, Geological Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, or Civil Engineering or are currently accepted into a graduate degree program in one of these fields at Missouri S&T. Once admitted to the program, the student must take the four designated courses (provided in the curriculum section). In order to receive a Graduate Certificate, the student must have an average cumulative grade point of 3.0 or better in the certificate courses.  Once admitted to the program, a student will be given three years to complete the program.
Students admitted to the Geophysics Certificate Program will have non-degree graduate status, however, they will earn graduate credit for the courses they complete. If the student completes the four-course sequence with a grade of B or better in each of the courses taken, they, upon application, will be admitted to the non-thesis M.S. degree program in Geology and Geophysics. The certificate credits taken by the students admitted to the M.S. degree program will count towards their master's degree. Students who do not have all of the prerequisite courses necessary to begin the courses in the Geophysics Certificate Program will be allowed to take ''bridge" courses at either the graduate or undergraduate level to prepare for the formal certificate courses.

Pathway to a Master's Degree
Are you a working professional who wants to earn your master's degree, but you don’t have time to take the GRE/GMAT? Then start in a graduate certificate program. Graduate certificates were designed as a pathway to a master's degree.* The admission requirements are more relaxed and credit earned will count toward your degree. Once you successfully earn your graduate certificate, you can continue with the corresponding master's degree without having to take the GRE/GMAT.
*Completion of a graduate certificate program does not automatically guarantee admission into a corresponding graduate degree program. To continue in a master’s degree program, you must apply.
