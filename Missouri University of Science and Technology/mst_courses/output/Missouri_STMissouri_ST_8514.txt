Solving For Petroleum's Industry
Your Career in Petroleum Engineering
Petroleum engineers extract oil, gas and other resources from the Earth, and they do it all over the world. They plan and supervise the drilling of wells, evaluate oil and gas production, and predict future production from the Gulf of Mexico to the coasts of Singapore. Aside from everyday gasoline, petroleum is also used inÂ  different fuels, and its byproducts are found in everything from car tires to toys.
Career as a petroleum engineer
S&T petroleum engineering grads work all over the world in the areas of drilling, production, and reservoir engineering of oil and gas fields.
