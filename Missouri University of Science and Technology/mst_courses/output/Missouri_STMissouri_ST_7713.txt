Master of Science in Industrial-Organizational Psychology
The Missouri University of Science and Technology Master of Science in Industrial Organizational Psychology emphasizes the application of psychological science to enhance the performance and well-being of people in organizations. S&T I-O psychologists will be well prepared to develop assessments of people for selection and placement into jobs, effective training programs, strategies for organizational development, measurement of performance, and ways to promote quality of work-life.  S&T students will receive a strong core foundation in industrial and organizational psychology as well as statistics and research methods.
The mission of the Master of Science program in Industrial-Organizational Psychology at
Missouri S&T is to provide diverse student cohorts with a strong foundation in
psychological theory, research, and methods that equips them for a variety of
applied
careers in

We aim to offer a rigorous yet flexible degree program which includes a balance of industrial and organizational focused curriculum.
