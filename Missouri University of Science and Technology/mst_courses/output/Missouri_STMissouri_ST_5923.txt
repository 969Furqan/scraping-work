Business and Management Systems
Undergraduate Degree
A degree in
business and management systems
equips you for virtually any management position where expertise in information technology is advantageous. The program offers a unique integration of the latest information technology trends with a strong foundation of business. Graduates in this field analyze organizational needs to provide technology-enabled management and operations solutions.
Today’s business leaders must be comfortable in a complex digital environment and have the skills to solve problems by efficiently synthesizing, analyzing and learning from vast amounts of information. They must also understand the growing role of technology in business and maximize its efficiency to support business operations and decision-making. Thus, all business majors are eligible to receive a minor in information science and technology without any additional coursework.
