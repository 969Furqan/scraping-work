Degree Information
Curriculum
An environmental science degree at Missouri S&T commences with a first-year seminar course that is taken concurrently with an introductory environmental science course, creating familiar student cohorts that can support and motivate one another through the program. Throughout their four years in the program, students are trained in five core areas: economics, biology, geology, environmental engineering, and humanities. In addition, they build foundational skills in mathematics, physical science, and communications. As they progress through the program, students increasingly connect ideas from among and within core areas to build their understanding of the integrated multidisciplinary concepts in environmental science. During their junior and senior years, students will be able to customize their degrees by selecting from a diverse array of elective courses within core areas. The degree’s flexible upper division elective choices also allow students to specialize and earn minors in core areas if they choose to do so.
Students apply the skills they learn in the classroom in hands-on laboratory and field courses. Students will finish their senior year with a capstone course that will be designed to engage them in professional development, connect them to career opportunities, hone their research and presentation skills through hands-on projects, and foster lifelong collegial relationships with their peers and instructors through intensive group work.
This curriculum benefits from a flexible design that allows students who may be transitioning from other programs on campus to complete the program in a timely manner. In addition, the degree creates opportunities for students to complete multiple minors within the degree, adding focus and strength to the interdisciplinary foundation.
All students pursuing the degree complete our interdisciplinary set of core courses and then can tailor their advanced electives with assistance from their academic advisor to their individual career goals. Degrees in this program are bolstered by coursework in chemistry, mathematics and physics. Actual curriculum plans may vary depending on transfer credit, math placement, and timing and availability of desired elective options.  These examples do not include all options available to students for completing a degree in this program.  For further details, please consult the undergraduate catalog.
Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science
A bachelor of science degree in environmental science requires 120 hours of coursework spread across 3 colleges and 6 disciplines. In addition, students complete an introductory freshman seminar for the major and an immersive capstone course where they prepare an environmental report from start to finish for an actual client.  Visit our course catalog for a full description of coursework or check out our sample curriculum, which guides you through one path to a bachelor of science degree in Environmental Science in 8 semesters.
The curriculum meets the requirements for industrial, federal and state entry-level environmental scientist positions. In addition, the curriculum prepares students for entry into graduate programs in environmental science, natural resources management, sustainability, forestry, and ecology.
Our campus in Rolla is situated in the middle of some of Missouri’s most prolific environmental resources and near some of the state’s most expansive environmental industries (e.g., mining, forestry, outdoor recreation). Missouri S&T also fosters strong connections with industry and creates opportunities for students through bi-annual job fairs, providing students with ample opportunities to gain real-world experience through internships, cooperative learning experiences, and volunteer opportunities. Program-affiliated faculty also offer connections to government and industry partners, laboratory and field research opportunities, and mentorship toward career goals.
There is no formal accreditation or licensure process for environmental scientists. Certification programs are available through the Ecological Society of America and other professional organizations. In conjunction with the minimum number of required years of experience, our curriculum meets the requirements for these certifications.

Your Career in Environmental Science
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, environmental scientists are in high demand due to increased public interest in environmental hazards, climate change, and the needs of a growing population. Many careers are concentrated in state and local governments and in industries that provide consulting services. According to 10-year projections, the market growth in demand for environmental scientists (8%), will exceed the average job growth demand (5%) and demand for wildlife biologists (5%), chemists (4%), and geoscientists (6%).
In addition to Environmental Scientist and Specialist jobs, a degree in Environmental Science qualifies graduates for a broad array of other positions not typically listed under “Environmental Scientist and Specialist” job titles.  Our Environmental Science degree’s coursework meets the minimum education qualifications for positions with titles such as wetlands biologist, biological science technician, ecologist, natural resources manager, land steward, conservation specialist, environmental educator, and forestry technician with private, state, federal, and NGO agencies.  Students with an Environmental Science degree also may choose to pursue graduate and professional programs.
