Degree Information
Areas of Study
Modern semiconductor fabrication plants (aka fabs or foundries) feature some of the worldâ€™s most complex manufacturing environments with highly specialized equipment and intricate material workflows. Consequently, fab organizational charts feature engineering job titles requiring expertise from a multitude of disciplines, including electrical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, computer science, and engineering management.
Key skills, abilities, and competencies needed for all types of fab engineers include basic knowledge of economics, statistical process control, programming, critical analysis and problem-solving skills. Applied domain knowledge in areas ranging from semiconductor materials processing and characterization, process controls and process integration to solid-state micro/nano-electronic devices, circuit analysis and testing, to semiconductor physics, theory and simulation is critical to meet the needs of the current and future domestic semiconductor workforce.
Our Bachelor of Science degree in Semiconductor Engineering consists of 128 credit hours and features two emphasis areas: semiconductor device engineering and semiconductor process engineering. All Semiconductor Engineering degree program graduates will receive a common foundation in general engineering (math, physical sciences, computer science, engineering problem solving and design) to complement a materials science and engineering core focused on developing fundamental understandings of characterization and structure-processing-property relationships in semiconductor materials.
Students following the semiconductor device engineering track explore fundamental concepts of electrical and computer engineering with an emphasis in circuits, electronics, devices, electromagnetics and digital logic. Students following the semiconductor process engineering track explore fundamental concepts of chemical engineering with an emphasis in material and energy balances, rate processes, unit operations, reactor design and control, process economics, and safety.
