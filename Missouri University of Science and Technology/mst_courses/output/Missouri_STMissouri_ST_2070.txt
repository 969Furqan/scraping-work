Program requirements
A candidate for the Ph.D. degree normally follows a program of 72 semester hours beyond the B.S. degree or 42 semester hours beyond the M.S. degree. Research for M.S. and Ph.D. may be coordinated, or a Ph.D. may be pursued without an M.S. degree.  The Ph.D. coursework must satisfy the departmental graduate core course requirement and must include
CHEM ENG 6100
,
CHEM ENG 6110
, and at least 6 additional hours of 6000-level courses in or out of the department for a minimum of twelve 6000-level credit hours. To maintain PhD candidacy, a minimum GPA of 3.0 from 5000- and 6000-level courses on campus is required.
In addition to the course requirements, all Ph.D. students must pass the qualifying exam, which consists of written and oral assignments specified by the department. The comprehensive examination, consisting of written and oral presentation of a research proposal, should be taken  following the completion of all required coursework and at least 12 weeks prior to the final examination. The final examination, consisting of the dissertation defense based on PhD research, should be conducted according to the rules of the graduate faculty, College of Engineering and Computing, and the department.  A PhD candidate, in consultation with the candidates research advisor, should form an advisory committee for comprehensive exam and dissertation defense. The advisory committee is chaired by the research advisor and must include at least three CHEM ENG faculty members.

Graduate funding
For Ph.D. students, we very seldom admit one without funding, meaning that we typically admit those who have been selected for Graduate Research Assistantships by professors having funded projects or Graduate Teaching Assistantships by the department.
