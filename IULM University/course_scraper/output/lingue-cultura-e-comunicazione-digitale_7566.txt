Academic Venue
The three-year Bachelor's degree course in Languages, Culture and Digital Communication is a newly conceived course that has been designed alongside the business world; it emerges from observing the evolution that the digital revolution is bringing about in the production and dissemination of knowledge. Within this course, the traditional disciplines linked to humanistic culture and knowledge of foreign languages provide the essential basis of the digital tools designed for the transmission and communication of knowledge. The course prepares students on both the humanistic-linguistic side and on the computer-digital side. The study plan includes the disciplines linked to humanistic culture, the study of foreign languages and the computer workshops and digital projects.

Areas of study
The Degree Program in Languages, Culture and Digital Communication, based on a principle that responds to the needs of the contemporary world and of the near future, is organised into three subject areas: humanistic, linguistic-communicative and IT-digital.
On the humanistic front, the presence of literatures (foreign, Italian, comparative) of philosophy and contemporary history allow the acquisition of the tools for understanding the present world.
On the linguistic-communicative learning front, the mastery of foreign languages (English compulsory and a language to be chosen from French, Spanish and German) and the ability to write Italian is acquired through the study of disciplines related to linguistics, psychology and sociology.
On the IT-digital front, knowledge related to the digital world is obtained through computer and digital design labs.
The specific nature of this course lies in the synergy between the three disciplinary areas aimed at creating professionals who know how to combine cultural content and linguistic skills with digital content.
Educational aims
The course aims to create professional figures equipped primarily with excellent competence in two foreign languages, with solid cultural knowledge and with a concrete basis in computer science, essential for acquiring skills in digital communication: professional figures ready to operate in a working world that is increasingly multilingual, globalised and dependent on technology.
The course prepares the student both on the humanistic-linguistic side and on the computer-digital side. The acquisition of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the studied languages (English and a second language chosen by the student from French, Spanish and German) is ensured by the foreign language courses; the ability to take a critical look at literary works is achieved thanks to the study of literature (foreign, Italian and comparative) to which meta-cognitive, meta-textual and sociological knowledge will be associated, ensured by the study of linguistics, philology, psychology, sociology and by the writing workshop in Italian; the computer and digital design laboratories provide the tools to carry out digital projects.
The preparation acquired will enable graduates to enter all those professional areas for which a solid knowledge of foreign languages and humanistic culture is required and skills in using IT tools. These are tools necessary to build the foundations of a digital culture central to the transformation processes that are, today, bringing together the world of industry, commerce and production.  At the same time, the course will enable students to acquire a solid base of knowledge necessary to undertake a Master's degree in Digital Humanities in the area of Languages and Literature or an area more specifically dedicated to Digital Communication.
