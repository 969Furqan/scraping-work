Learning outcomes
The Fashion and Creative Industries degree course provides the basic knowledge and skills to work within the communication and creative processes of fashion and the creative industries. The dynamic scenarios that characterise these sectors require professionals who know how to combine the cultural, communicative and symbolic dimensions underlying the processes of design, development and promotion of artistic and creative products.
To meet these needs, the course of study provides for two main areas of learning:
- the historical-artistic-cultural area, which provides the historical-critical knowledge and skills necessary for understanding fashion and the creative industries; the languages of contemporary visual arts useful for interpreting fashion also in its relationship with different media; the history of fashion, design and Made in Italy, which share the same languages and draw on common cultural and attitudinal resources.
- the area of socio-anthropology, which provides the knowledge, skills and ability to use communication tools to enhance fashion creations and the products of other creative industries, from advertising to events, from the web to social media, with a focus on the issues of interculturality, inclusivity and sustainability.
As a corollary to these areas, the course provides adequate economic and legal expertise for understanding the management dynamics and budgets of companies competing in the creative industries, for researching and interpreting cultural and style trends, and for navigating through the regulations concerning the protection of intellectual property of creative products, also in international contexts.
The course is characterised by a workshop approach that will enable students to acquire effective communication techniques - written, oral and visual - and the ability to use the main web and social media communication tools.
Particular attention is paid to the development of:
- historical-critical knowledge necessary for the understanding of contemporary visual arts
- specific skills in the history and culture of fashion and design
- effective communication skills and abilities - written, oral and visual
- economic-legal skills
- skills in research and interpretation of cultural and style trends
- skills in inter-culturalism, sustainability and inclusiveness
- command of the English language
After a common start, at the end of the second year, students will be able to choose whether to study in-depth the themes of the Fashion or Creative Industries and Design sectors. The course is divided into two distinct areas of study, enabling students to acquire specialist skills in their chosen field.
The course's teaching, carried out by internal teachers and professionals in the sector, is characterised by innovative content and methods based on a strong integration of academic lessons, workshops, project work and experience "in the field".

Final test
The final test consists of the illustration and discussion before a committee of teachers of a topic related to one of the courses included in the study plan on which the student has prepared a written paper.
The paper may consist either in a substantial description of a topic consistent with the scientific and professional interests of the degree course, and supported by knowledge of the relevant reading list, or in the description of an activity of an applied and/or experimental nature, which represents a greater individual contribution by the candidate.
The graduation examination consists of a brief presentation and discussion (open to the public but without any ceremonial character) of the final dissertation in the presence of a Committee - known as the "Examination Committee" - consisting of three lecturers, who may or may not belong to the same Faculty, in the subject area of the dissertation. At the end of the session, the Examination Committee communicates to all candidates only the summary grade assigned (from insufficient to excellent).
