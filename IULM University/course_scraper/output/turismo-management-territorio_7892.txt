Areas of Study
The main objective of the Bachelor's Degree Course in Tourism, Management and Culture, within the Tourism Sciences degree class, is to provide young graduates with in-depth knowledge of techniques for analysing a territorial context, the management of tourism enterprises, including start-ups, together with a historical-critical reference framework and sound background knowledge regarding the relationship between tourism and local development, international organisations and digital communication.
The aim is to consolidate the need to ensure English language proficiency, as well as to take the opportunity to provide a more professionally-oriented programme, reinforcing the workshop approach with the constant presence of professionals and the Professional Skills Internship. This will respond to the needs of students who wish to customise their vocational training on the range of optional courses. In the second year there is the possibility of choosing a second foreign language.
Students learn, therefore, how to reshape traditional skills in accordance with the flexibility required by a world of work that encompasses local development, the evolution of tourism, the processes of territorialisation and empowerment, marketing and digital communication, product design, the importance of competitive strategies and performance measurement, and the priority of networks between companies, non-profit organisations and enterprises, public administration, destination managers and international organisations, operating and grant-making foundations.
Furthermore, students will be able to place what they have learnt in contexts of sustainable development, intercultural dialogue and sustainable valorisation, in line with European and international standards and directives, supported in this by a mastery of the English language, which will enable them to transfer their knowledge transversally to national and international markets.
In the third year, the degree course is divided into two different programmes: Tourism Communication and Tourism Management and Organisation. The two programmes aim to bring graduates closer to current job opportunities and professional fields, which, together with the internship and final examination, delineate highly distinctive and innovative professional figures.
The course is characterised by subjects including:
Cultural Geography
Cultural Heritage for Tourism
Contemporary History
The Economic System of Tourism
Management of Tourism Enterprises
Destination Management
Psychology and Sociology of Tourism
Travel Blogging
Territory and Culture
Tourism Law
Urban Tourism and Sustainability
Training objectives
The main objective of the Degree Course in Tourism, Management and Culture (Degree Class: Tourism Science) is the preparation of young graduates with a thorough knowledge of the tourism economic system, of territorial contexts and their dynamics, the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the territories, management and of the definition of competitive strategies in start-up companies, together with a solid grounding in the contexts and salient historical events with particular reference to tourism.
In addition, with the support of digital communication tools, graduates must be able to enter the various scenarios of sustainable development, intercultural dialogue and the sustainable enhancement of tangible and intangible assets, using their knowledge base of European and international standards and directives, and supported by their English language proficiency that has been developed throughout the three-year programme.
The Course aims to create a professional figure, favouring immediate entry into the workplace on completion of the three-year cycle.
Particularly important is the internship experience, including ad hoc training activities within the framework of the course of study. Workshops are also included in many training activities. The final test consists of a research and documentation report on a case study based on an appropriate theme, possibly drafted initially during the period of internship.
The course is characterized by the attention paid to professional skills, favoured by a workshop-based approach, which include various training activities, job labs and internships. The programme focuses on current trends in tourism and includes a wide range of training activities ranging from digital communication to performance in the tourism sectors, from start-ups in the tourism sector to local development.

Final test
The study programme terminates with the preparation of a paper as specified in "Rules for the procedures for discussion and awarding the degree".
The degree classification is expressed out of 110 and the grade is based on the curriculum vitae of the student's studies, the grade assigned to the final exam and further elements of assessment on the basis of a grid approved by the Faculty Council.
The degree exam consists of a brief presentation and discussion (open to the public but not ceremonial) of the Dissertation to the Preliminary Committee composed of three lecturers (not necessarily from the same Faculty nor academic area under discussion). On completion of the examination session, the Preliminary Committee communicates to all candidates only the evaluation of the dissertation attributed by the Committee (from insufficient to excellent).
The degree classification is then attributed by the Certification Committee, taking into consideration the evaluation of the final dissertation attributed by the Preliminary Committee, the candidate's grades accrued from formal examinations and other elements based on elements approved by the Faculty Council and is expressed as a mark out of 110. The Certification Commission is composed of seven lecturers from the relevant Faculty and is chaired by the Dean. Members of the Commissions are appointed by the Dean of the Faculty.
The proclamation and conferral of the degree certificate takes place during the Graduation Ceremony held at the end of the graduation session. This event is open to the public and is delivered in a ceremonial manner.
