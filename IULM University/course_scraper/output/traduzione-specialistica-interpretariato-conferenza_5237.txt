Final exam
With their degree thesis, students complete their master's degree course by developing scientific research in the fields of translation, linguistics, stylistics, history, theory, methodology and deontology, which can be traced back to the problems of specialised translation and interpreting starting from the areas of study dealt with during the course of their training. With their thesis, students demonstrate their knowledge of the subject, as well as their ability to research, select and structure critical bibliography and content through a master's thesis whose contents are characterized by originality and rigor in the scientific approach.
The final test consists in the discussion, before a Lecturers' Committee, of an original Dissertation, in Italian or in one of the two foreign languages studied, developed by the student under the guidance of a supervisor and a linguistic tutor. The Selection Boards for the Final Round and for the awarding of the qualification - composed of at least seven members, of which at least four are official Professors of the Faculty or of courses taken from other Faculties - are appointed by the Dean of the Faculty. The Commissions are presided over by the Dean of the Faculty or, in his absence, by the most senior Lecturer. The degree grade is expressed in one hundred and tenths and is given by the average of the grades relating to the exams taken in the course of study and the score attributed to the thesis. In case of insufficient assessment, the student is required to repeat the Final Dissertation. The score attributable to the thesis ranges from 0 to 11 points
