Final exam
The final dissertation of the degree course consists in the drafting and discussion, under the guidance of a supervisor, of a thesis.
The thesis must have the characteristics of a scientific dissertation, in which the student must demonstrate that s/he is able to apply in an appropriate and original way the theoretical-critical knowledge learned in the training course and that s/he has an autonomous and rigorous research methodology, developing a problematic and in-depth approach to one of the topics addressed in the degree course or to a new and innovative theme. Conceived as the completion of a training course on the media universe, the degree thesis can be supplemented by images, films or other hypertextual and/or multimedia appendices that document, in addition to scientific knowledge, the technical, professional and creative skills acquired by the student.
The final test consists in the oral presentation of the degree thesis before a Commission of lecturers, two of whom, the supervisor (who followed the drafting step by step) and the co-supervisor (who read the completed piece of work), are called to lead the discussion
The Commission that judges the final exam and decides on the award of the degree is appointed by the Dean of the Faculty and is composed of at least seven members, of which at least four are official Professors of the Faculty or of courses taken from other Faculties. The Commission makes a brief qualitative assessment of the final test (insufficient, sufficient, decent, good, very good, excellent), taking into account both the assessment of the thesis expressed by the supervisor and co-supervisor, and the discussion supported by the student. This valuation gives the right to the acquisition of the envisaged credits. In case of negative assessment, the student is required to repeat the final dissertation. The degree grade is expressed collectively by the Commission in one hundred and tenths, taking into account not only the evaluation of the final exam, but also the curriculum of the student's studies.
