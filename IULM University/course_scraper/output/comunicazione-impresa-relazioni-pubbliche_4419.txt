Areas of Study
The Bachelor Programme in Corporate Communication and Public Relations at IULM University, the first one created in Italy, was created to prepare graduates who intend to become professionals in the management of internal and external communication processes of private and public organisations.
A professional able to use all communication tools, from advertising, on which is traditionally based the promotion of goods and services, to new media related to the spread of the Internet that allow a strong customization of messages and an explicit interaction with the interlocutor.
The Bachelor's degree programme therefore prepares students to use a set of complex skills, which require not only an understanding of the mechanisms that govern communication, but of those that govern the life of the institutions that generate it and of the individuals who receive it, and of the economic and social context within which it takes on meaning.
To train
communication professionals with an international mind-set
, from the academic year 2019-2020 the course is also offered for the first time in English. The program of the Bachelor Programme in Corporate Communication and Public Relations is symmetrical to the course in Italian,
and is aimed at new students who have already matured a clear predisposition towards an international career pathway.
Fundamental Modules
Marketing
Public relations and corporate communication

Dual Degree
Students will be able to obtain a dual degree, in cooperation with
Dublin Business School or with Royal Roads University*.

and it is addressed to students enrolled in their second year of Corporate Communication and Public Relations.
Assignees will attend their third year at Dublin Business School (the whole year or an intensive semester) and obtain the

Final Exam
On completion of the taught component of the study programme, students must produce their own piece of written work relating to one of the topics covered in the programme.This Final Dissertation may be presented in the form of an article, essay or case study and based on a well-defined thesis. The paper may be of variable length (not less than 20,000 characters) and presented according to the approved guidelines for written assessed work and should include an appropriate bibliography.
In preparing the dissertation, the student is assisted by supervisor who helps in defining the topic to be discussed, the layout and presentation and how to source appropriate and relevant bibliographic and supporting materials. Once the dissertation has been approved by the supervisor, it is presented to a committee for evaluation. The final draft may be presented in English provided that it contains an abstract (no less than 8,000 characters) in Italian.
When presenting the final dissertation, the student may use multimedia supports materials and instruments.
The degree exam consists of a brief presentation and discussion (open to the public but not ceremonial) of the Dissertation to the Preliminary Committee composed of three lecturers (not necessarily from the same Faculty nor academic area under discussion). On completion of the examination session, the Preliminary Committee communicates to all candidates only the evaluation of the dissertation attributed by the Committee (from insufficient to excellent).
The degree classification is then attributed by the Certification Committee, taking into consideration the evaluation of the final dissertation attributed by the Preliminary Committee, the candidate's grades accrued from formal examinations and other elements based on elements approved by the Faculty Council and is expressed as a mark out of 110. The Certification Commission is composed of seven lecturers from the relevant Faculty and is chaired by the Dean. Members of the Commissions are appointed by the Dean of the Faculty.
The proclamation and conferral of the degree certificate takes place during the Graduation Ceremony held at the end of the graduation session. This event is open to the public and is delivered in a ceremonial manner.
