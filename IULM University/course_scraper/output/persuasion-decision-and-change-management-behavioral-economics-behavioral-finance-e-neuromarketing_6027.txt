The first Master's course in Italy to teach the principles of Behavioural Economics
and Neuromarketing and their applications to effectively guide decision-making processes.
Knowledge of Behavioural Economics is transversally integrated with many existing professional roles, enriching them with the ability to interpret and govern the processes of change in work, social and market contexts.
The
goal
of the master is to train an architect of choices able to design behaviour-based actions to stimulate and effectively govern change.
Behavioural Economics, a scientific discipline of relatively recent development, is proposed as a current and applied key to interpreting the human being in the face of change.
The key competence developed during the master
is the ability to observe and scientifically interpret the behaviour, even in its dimensions most hidden and peculiar to the human being: verbal behaviour, thought processes, emotions.
To this end, the programme integrates a neuromarketing pathway that will provide fundamental tools for investigating neural correlates to mental activities and human decision-making processes.
Thematic areas:
Behavioral Finance and Insurance (60 hours)
Behavioral Insights and Interventions (60 hours)
Each module of the course is complemented by workshops to learn the use of empirical methodologies and appropriate intervention tools of immediate application
The course provide the student with in-depth theoretical knowledge and applicative mastery of the processes of change involving human beings.
