The Master's Degree Course in Fashion Communication and Luxury Strategies offers an
advanced course to enter the world of fashion and luxury with full awareness of the
challenges of what are now fully global industries. The Course aims to train fashion and
luxury communication professionals, managers, and business consultants so that they are
capable of facing the challenges of contemporary communication, contextualising them,
and transferring products and experiences to the public with a new language; they will also
be capable of taking on roles of responsibility within established or start-up companies, and
of seizing all the opportunities of complex systems.

Face-to-face teaching is flanked by seminars, workshops, meetings with professionals and "in the field" experiences. To allow for a high degree of specialisation, the course offers two possible routes in the second year:
Global Trends and
Luxury Strategies
, with the former more focused on fashion industry issues and the latter on luxury (products and experiences).
The course, taught in English, will allow students to develop a dynamic and flexible approach to communication, which is essential for working in increasingly horizontal companies. The first year includes teaching Team and Project Management to familiarise students with the logic and dynamics of organisations. A great deal of attention is paid to the specifics of digital communication. The course offers a solid cultural foundation and has a curriculum with a robust humanistic vocation to develop the lateral thinking required for positions of responsibility. The structure of the course, due to its workshop teaching and multidisciplinary approach, stimulates flexibility and the ability to learn in a self-directed and independent manner.

Areas of study
The Master's Degree Course in Fashion Communication and Luxury Strategies intends to impart the knowledge necessary to build a high-level professional path in fashion and luxury communication.
The course will provide advanced philosophical, sociological, economic, management and organizational skills specific to luxury and fashion communication. It is a specialized program that strives to train figures who can hold roles of responsibility and participate as protagonists in a world such as luxury and fashion communication, which must constantly reinvent itself in the light of technological innovation, changes in consumer tastes and sensibilities, and the challenges posed by the construction of brands and identities in culturally diverse and changing contexts. Great emphasis is placed on digital communication.
The Course features teachings such as:
Anthropology of Fashion and Luxury
Cognitive Foundations of Economics
Digital Trends and Marketing Statistics
Fashion Trends
Imaginery of Luxury
Learning objectives
In the curriculum of the master's degree program in Fashion Communication and Luxury Strategies shall focus on the specific areas of fashion and luxury communication. Students will also have the opportunity to approach those disciplines that enable them to better appreciate such topics as agent behavior, its determinants, as well as its historical and international context. Accosting sociological, political, philosophical, anthropological and economic disciplines is also of crucial importance for a full understanding of trends that affect both the fashion industry and our contemporary world at large.
The differentiation of addresses in the second year ("Global Trends" and "Luxury Fashion"), will enable students to delve respectively into the aspects of fashion communication in a multicultural and changing world or the communication and culture of luxury industries.
Through its educational offerings, the course proposes to provide a contextual culture that is essential to fully master the developments in perception frameworks, particularly as applicable to the fashion and luxury market. In particular, it intends to provide a full understanding of the interaction between aesthetics and communication, the acquisition of rudiments of neuroscience for economics, knowledge of the specific languages of communication and luxury in its different historical declinations, and an in-depth study of the contexts of the contemporary world under social, political and economic profiles.
The course is delivered in English and is likewise designed to offer skills that are useful and expendable in the international context.
