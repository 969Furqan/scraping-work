Areas of Study
The Bachelor’s degree course in Arts and Cultural Events covers is organized in different disciplinary sectors, ranging from arts to the social sciences, from traditional to digital languages, from event marketing and management to the performing arts.
There are three subject areas:
1) Criticism, art history, the performing arts
2) Languages, history, sociology
3) Economics, management, law
Thanks to the basic and core courses, the graduate in Arts and Cultural Events is able to independently apply the acquired knowledge to "narrate" and enhance historical and cultural heritage, and also to "construct" artistic and cultural content targeting different audiences.
The elective courses enable graduates to develop business plans, management and marketing plans, and communication plans for cultural activities.
The language courses will help students to use English effectively and provide the basics of a second foreign language.

Training objectives
The Bachelor's Degree Course in Arts and Cultural Events provides students with the basic skills needed to enter the fields of arts and cultural activities. It trains people capable of translating a cultural plan into an operational plan, providing them with the critical knowledge of specific languages alongside the study and implementation of methodologies aimed at enhancing the respective products. The aim is not only to foster the development of specific skills in the construction of artistic and cultural contents, and in the communication of these contents to different audiences, but also to develop management skills in the organisation of events in the sector.
These objectives are achieved through a continuous dialogue between theory and application; between humanistic disciplines - such as history, art history, art and media cultures - and subjects that help to strengthen management, communication and language skills, and explore sociological, economic and legal aspects.
The course offers lectures and workshops held by university lecturers, artists and professionals operating in emerging sectors, as well as direct "hands-on" experience. Study visits to museums and foundations, series of meetings with protagonists of arts, culture and entertainment sectors, projects and collaboration with external organisations, internships and apprenticeships in Italy and abroad complete the training programme. These opportunities are guaranteed by collaborations that have been established by the Faculty, reserved for the students, such as our partnership with MIA FAIR, and also by many other professionalising experiences.

Final test
The final test consists in the presentation and discussion in front of a committee of teachers of a paper related to one of the subjects provided for in the Study Programme.
This paper may consist both in the description of a topic consistent with the scientific and professional focus of the degree programme and supported by a relevant basic bibliography, and in the description of an activity of an applicative and/or experimental nature, which constitutes a greater individual contribution by the student.
The degree exam consists of a brief presentation and discussion (open to the public but not ceremonial) of the Dissertation to the Preliminary Committee composed of three lecturers (not necessarily from the same Faculty nor academic area under discussion). On completion of the examination session, the Preliminary Committee communicates to all candidates only the evaluation of the dissertation attributed by the Committee (from insufficient to excellent).
The degree classification is then attributed by the Certification Committee, taking into consideration the evaluation of the final dissertation attributed by the Preliminary Committee, the candidate's grades accrued from formal examinations and other elements based on elements approved by the Faculty Council and is expressed as a mark out of 110. The Certification Commission is composed of seven lecturers from the relevant Faculty and is chaired by the Dean. Members of the Commissions are appointed by the Dean of the Faculty.
The proclamation and conferral of the degree certificate takes place during the Graduation Ceremony held at the end of the graduation session. This event is open to the public and is delivered in a ceremonial manner.
