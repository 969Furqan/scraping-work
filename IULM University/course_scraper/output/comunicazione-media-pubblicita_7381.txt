To complete the programme, you need to accrue 180 credits (ECTS) to be chosen from a range of academic modules or other activities. These credits can be chosen from a wide range, including those activated on other Bachelor programmes. You can ask the Student Office for assistance in choosing the modules for your study programme.
Final Dissertation
On completion of the taught component of the study programme, students must produce their own piece of written work relating to one of the topics covered in the programme.
This Final Dissertation may be presented in the form of an article, essay or case study and based on a well-defined thesis. The paper may be of variable length 
(not less than 20,000 characters) 

and presented according to the approved guidelines for written assessed work and should include an appropriate bibliography.
In preparing the dissertation, the student is assisted by supervisor who helps in defining the topic to be discussed, the layout and presentation and how to source appropriate and relevant bibliographic and supporting materials. Once the dissertation has been approved by the supervisor, it is presented to a committee for evaluation.
The final draft may be presented in English provided that it contains an abstract (no less than 8,000 characters) in Italian.
When presenting the final dissertation, the student may use multimedia supports materials and instruments.
The degree exam consists of a brief presentation and discussion (open to the public but not ceremonial) of the Dissertation to the Preliminary Committee composed of three lecturers (not necessarily from the same Faculty nor academic area under discussion). On completion of the examination session, the Preliminary Committee communicates to all candidates only the evaluation of the dissertation attributed by the Committee (from insufficient to excellent).
The degree classification is then attributed by the Certification Committee, taking into consideration the evaluation of the final dissertation attributed by the Preliminary Committee, the candidate's grades accrued from formal examinations and other elements based on elements approved by the Faculty Council and is expressed as a mark out of 110. The Certification Commission is composed of seven lecturers from the relevant Faculty and is chaired by the Dean. Members of the Commissions are appointed by the Dean of the Faculty.
The proclamation and consignment of the degree certificate takes place during the Graduation Ceremony held at the end of the graduation session. This event is open to the public and is delivered in a ceremonial manner.
