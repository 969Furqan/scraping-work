The Master's Degree Course in Art, Valorization Strategies and the Markets provides advanced skills in art history, management, organisation and economics specific to the cultural professions market and the arts system. This specialised course aims to train managers, critics, art exhibition curators, cultural communicators, gallery owners, museum directors and consultants capable of managing the relationship between art and the market in all its phases. In particular, understanding and controlling cultural production processes, designing, organising and communicating art events, and disseminating art also through digital systems.
The Course comprises a series of lectures followed by one-to-one experiences with practising professionals, seminars, workshops and 'in the field' experiences, alongside an ample range of workshop activities. Cycles of lectures with protagonists of the art, culture and entertainment system, opportunities for interaction with public and private institutions and foundations (such as the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo), projects and collaboration with external bodies, internships and apprenticeships with national and international partners complete the programme. In order to further strengthen the professionalising structure, particular emphasis is placed on the curatorial and digital area of training, offering students the opportunity to choose their specialisation. Thanks to agreements with European and non-European universities, in the first semester of the second year, students have the opportunity to enhance their curriculum with a study period abroad.
The international educational offer is further enriched by the possibility of obtaining a double Italian-French Master’s degree thanks to the agreement that IULM University has entered into with ICART (L'école du management de la culture et du marché de l'art) in Paris. In the second semester of the second year, workshops on design, production and artistic and cultural communication in partnership with leading organisations and institutions on the Italian scene based in Milan (including the Leonardo da Vinci National Museum of Science and Technology, MEET - International Centre for Digital Culture) allow students to work on the realisation of specific projects, on their premises and in close contact with professionals working in the sector. The two-year course concludes with the writing and discussion of the thesis.

Teaching objectives
In the Master's Degree Course in Art, Valorization Strategies and the Markets, artistic and critical-methodological knowledge is combined with legal-economic knowledge in order to provide different approaches to analysing and interpreting all aspects of art and its markets.
In the first year, in particular, students have the opportunity to deepen their studies of visual cultures, collecting and the antiques market, as well as narrative techniques for art events, and to analyse the legal-economic dimension of the cultural heritage system, with specific focus on museum management, art market strategies and new forms of business.
In the second year, on the other hand, students address theoretical and practical issues related to the design of artistic and cultural events, and the relationship between art and the web, exploring the connection between philosophy and the art world.
The second-year course is rounded out with workshops on design, production and artistic-cultural communication in collaboration with leading Italian organisations and institutions. Partners who, by opening the doors of their offices, guarantee our students the opportunity to gain experience on concrete projects in direct contact with expert staff working in the various sectors of the cultural professions system. A professionalising opportunity that enriches the overall training offer and the individual subjects taught in a perspective of synergy between the academic world and the world of work.
Lessons in class followed by direct experience with professionals in the sector, seminars in preparation for workshops and "in the field" experiences, alongside extensive workshop activities, form the backbone of the Degree Course. Cycles of seminars with leading figures from the art, culture and entertainment system, opportunities to meet with public and private institutions and foundations, projects and collaborations with external bodies, internships and apprenticeships in Italy and abroad complete the programme.
The Master's thesis, together with project work realised in the workshop on design, production and artistic and cultural communication, completes the students' course of study.

Thesis
The Final Dissertation consists of a presentation, before a Commission of lecturers, chaired by a supervisor and a co-supervisor, of the dissertation of the master's degree, in the form of a large written paper
Without prejudice to the obligations of originality, bibliographic updating, critical evaluation skills and methodological rigour, the dissertation may rather be based on the method of research conducted on previous scientific literature, i.e. it may represent a more markedly original work capable of configuring, at least at the beginning, a personal contribution to research on the subject
The Selection Boards for the Final Dissertation and for the awarding of the qualification - composed of at least seven members, of which at least four are official Professors of the Faculty or of courses taken from other Faculties - are appointed by the Dean of the Faculty. The Commissions are presided over by the Dean of the Faculty or, in his absence, by the most senior Lecturer or the most senior Lecturer
The Commission expresses a brief qualitative evaluation of the Final Round (insufficient, sufficient, decent, good, excellent, excellent), which takes into account both the evaluation of the thesis expressed by the Supervisor and the Co-supervisor, and the discussion of the thesis supported by the Candidate. This valuation gives the right to the acquisition of the envisaged credits. In case of negative assessment, the student is required to repeat the Final Dissertation
The degree grade is expressed collectively by the Commission in one hundred and tenths on the basis of the evaluation of the curriculum of the studies (number and grade of curricular and extra-curricular training activities, years of course, any internship not required, periods of study abroad within the framework of European programs) and the evaluation assigned to the Final Dissertation
