The final exam consists of a written paper of between 30 and 40 pages (2000 characters each) in which the student will deal with a topic related to one of the courses of the study plan; the topic (and its theoretical, methodological, content and/or practical or experimental approach) will be agreed with the teacher of the chosen course, who will supervise the work of the student in the various stages of writing, from bibliography to final editing. The paper, written in Italian, must be accompanied by a summary in English or the second foreign language studied; once approved by the supervisor, it will be evaluated by a Commission according to the University's Academic Regulations.
