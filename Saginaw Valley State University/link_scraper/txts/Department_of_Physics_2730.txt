Department of Physics
The Department of Physics offers four programs in physics leading to the B.S. degree. A student contemplating a physics major should arrange for an early interview with the department, so that his or her interest and future career can be considered in the planning of the program.
In addition to the requirements described below for each program, the distribution and general requirements listed in the catalog should be fulfilled. A student planning a physics major is encouraged to take a year of college calculus as early as possible.
SERVICE LEARNING
SVSU students address the needs of local and global communities through the integration of meaningful service and traditional instruction that incorporates reflection and critical thinking to enrich the learning experience.
