Shayla graduated in 2019.  In the 2019 American Advertising Federation Awards, her work was forwarded to the regional level of the competition in Chicago, where she receive a Gold Addy for her branding campaign. She received two Silver Addy Awards in the Professional Division of the Advertising Federation in the 2020 Great Lakes Bay Addy.  Within the student division of the local A.F.A,she received "Best of Show,"  Greatest assets of the SVSU Art Department:is the smaller classroom sizes. This allows for the students and professors to become more familiar with each other and their design work. It is beneficial to have a professor that is aware of a student's progress and can help to pinpoint areas of both success and improvement, as a student progresses through the program. Smaller classroom sizes also help to make sure that students aren’t just a number. They receive more specific guidance towards their design work as opposed to general information and critics that are often applied to larger classroom sizes.

I recommend SVSU's Art Dept because of the smaller class sizes and personable faculty.  I loved knowing the majority of fellow art students and your professors took the time to get to know you.  I always felt free to experiment and the critique environment was very positive.  I also feel critiques helped me become a better person overall.  Reflecting back on studio classes I remember them being "fun" and really loved the group setting to bounce creative ideas off other people in the class or laugh together over 80s metal.  I was able to create independent study classes and use tools from traditional printmaking and computer graphic design courses to make images for my BFA show.  Overall, it was rigorous and created a wonderful base of knowledge for me to continue to make art on my own after SVSU.  The general vibe of the department is very welcoming, open, supportive, and fun.

Degree:  Bachelor of Fine Arts in graphic design, May 2020
Greatest Assets of SVSU Art Department:The Art Department at SVSU has been such a strong support system in this journey. Going into the program I was nervous about creating a children’s books because I had no experience in it. However, with advice and suggestions from the art department I was able to create work that I am so proud of. This opportunity to work with such creative minds was a challenge and honor, and I’ve come out of it learning so much about myself and my artwork. I cannot thank my committee and the art department enough for their support through this adventure."
