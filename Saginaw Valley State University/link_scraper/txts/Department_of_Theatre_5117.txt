Department of Theatre
At SVSU, the Department of Theatre is dedicated to nurturing individuals' creative talents through comprehensive study and hands-on application. Our program offers an immersive scholarship experience that includes an audition process and selective criteria, simulating real-world theatrical involvement from behind the scenes.
Our curriculum explores the perspectives of theatre in Western civilization, fosters an understanding of dramatic literature, and encourages the development of various artistic outlets. This combination ensures that SVSU students gain a solid foundation in both the theory and practice of theatre.
Additionally, our live theatrical productions provide invaluable opportunities for artistic and cultural enrichment to our students, the university community, and the wider public.
