Department of Communication
Communication is the dynamic process of message exchange between a sender and receiver. By studying this academic discipline, students learn to develop their communication skills and are empowered with the ability to apply them in their professional careers and personal relationships. The communication program at Saginaw Valley State University focuses on such areas of communication as nonverbal, interpersonal, group, family, gender, persuasion, performance, business, and organization. Courses in theory, research and the role of communication in various settings allow students to evaluate why communication is important and how they can effectively apply the skills they have developed.
If you are interested in human interaction, mass media or developing skills that will improve your career and personal relationships, then this program has been designed for you.
SERVICE LEARNING
