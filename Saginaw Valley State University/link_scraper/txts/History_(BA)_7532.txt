About
History is the foundation of good citizenship and teaches skills that are applicable in a variety of professions.
Historians investigate the many perspectives of past people and events
, show us where we are and help us determine where we may be going. History majors have a deep understanding of the society in which they live. They
critically analyze and interpret large amounts of information
and come to informed judgments.
SVSU History instructors are working historians
with a strong focus on oral history, providing students with
opportunities to work with faculty
doing research on local, national and global history. If you are fascinated by history and want to
seek opportunities
in this field, the SVSU History program is your place to develop and strengthen skills in written and oral communication, collaborative work, critical thinking, research, analysis and content mastery—competencies in high-demand across a broad range of careers.
