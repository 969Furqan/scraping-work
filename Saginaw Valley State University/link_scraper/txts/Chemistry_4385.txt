Chemistry
From the wonder of covalent bonds to the intricacy of DNA, chemistry touches every aspect of the life we live and the world we help to create. When you are at SVSU, you study those bonds and relationships up close. Whether assisting faculty with their research or conducting your own, SVSU helps you NOT ONLY CONQUER THE CLASSROOM BUT DISCOVER THE WORLD BEYOND IT. And at SVSU, we’re graduating chemists who go on to become doctors, analysts, professors and researchers all over the country. Join them—and start your Cardinal story.
Professor of the Year
Tami Sivy, professor of chemistry, has
received the Michigan Distinguished Professor of the Year award
from the Michigan Association of State Universities. The award recognizes the outstanding contributions and dedication exhibited by the faculty from Michigan’s 15 public universities to the education of undergraduate students. She is one of three professors in the state to receive the honor.
Course of Study
Beneath the umbrella of chemistry, SVSU offers an elite and engaging set of majors for all kinds of driven scientific minds. From training for secondary chemistry educators to more specialized approaches such as business chemistry and chemical physics, the academic options at SVSU blend rigorous study in the classroom with creative and empowering training in the lab. SVSU faculty offer both brilliance and empathy to our students, not only helping you understand critical concepts but also working hard to support you in your personal career aspirations. Whether you have a passion for organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry or prefer something in the physical, analytical and environmental chemistries—SVSU offers the support you need to cultivate your passion and thrive.
Student Opportunities
At SVSU, we’ll teach you the basics but also take you far beyond the classroom. Cardinal undergraduate students benefit from conducting their own research projects in a chemistry lab—a privilege rarely experienced at bigger universities. SVSU arms you with skills that outpace all competition as you consider options such as medical school, graduate programs and career opportunities with large research companies. In addition, SVSU offers chemistry students the chance to join a variety of organizations such as the Chemistry Club as well as participate in active research in the Kawkawlin River.

Medical School
Many SVSU students aspire to enter the medical profession — and many achieve their goal because at SVSU we not only offer you goal setting and progress check-ins with our pre-medical adviser, we also connect you with elite in-hospital programs such as the Medical Scribes program with Covenant Hospital. SVSU students have interned with distinguished health organizations such as Michigan State and have been accepted at leading medical schools across the nation, from our backyard in Lansing to Nashville. At SVSU you will find professors and opportunities to help you succeed in your pre-medical goals.
Job Opportunities
The life of a chemist can take you anywhere, be it the classroom, the boardroom or the research lab. SVSU is proud of our Cardinal graduates who achieve a 95 percent placement rate after graduation. Students who major in chemistry go on to work for organizations such as the EPA, NASA and the CDC. You’ll also have the opportunity to apply your skills in power plants, universities, agriculture and pharmaceuticals or any production industry in the world.
