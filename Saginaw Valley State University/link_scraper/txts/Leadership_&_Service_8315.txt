Leadership & Service
The Leadership & Service Minor is designed for students to learn to lead and serve with integrity in ways that will transform their
lives, the lives of others, and the communities in which they live. Students enrolled in the Leadership & Service Minor will also be able to engage with program integrating experiences through the co-curricular leadership programs offered at Saginaw Valley State University. The Leadership & Service Minor serves as an important addition or complement to help prepare students for leadership roles within their communities.
SERVICE LEARNING
SVSU students address the needs of local and global communities through the integration of meaningful service and traditional instruction that incorporates reflection and critical thinking to enrich the learning experience.
