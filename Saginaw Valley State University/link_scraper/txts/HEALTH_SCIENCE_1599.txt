MEET A CARDINAL
Student Jarrod Eaton accompanied faculty to Nepal during the 2015 earthquakes. In Nepal, theories from the classroom were brought to life in vivid color, and Jarrod decided to dedicate his life to caring for those systemically disadvantaged in their health care. Jarrod’s most formational experiences happened beyond the classroom: both in Nepal and at World Congress on Public Health and Nutrition in Rome, Italy. Now, he’s continuing that story at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.
