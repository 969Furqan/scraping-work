About
General Business majors have tremendous flexibility to create a plan that fits their interests and ambitions
. Students select three areas of focus from a wide range of options to create a well-rounded portfolio of skills and experiences that will allow them to contribute to a business in a variety of capacities. With carefully selected courses and real-world projects, this is terrific preparation to work for a small business or start-up that succeeds based on broad skills rather than employee specialization.
