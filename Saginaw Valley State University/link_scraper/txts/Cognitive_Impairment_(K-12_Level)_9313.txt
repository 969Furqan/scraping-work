Description of Endorsement:
The Cognitive Impairment (SA) endorsement allows elementary and secondary-level certified teachers to teach in K-12 special education resource rooms and Cognitive Impairment programs. They can teach the entire K-12 curriculum to their special education students as approved by the local school board and intermediate school district, provided they have satisfied the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEIA) requirements for a Highly Qualified teacher in core academic areas for which they provide direct instruction. Â The College of Education will recommend teachers for the K-12 Cognitive Impairment endorsement upon successful completion of all required coursework and the Michigan Test for Teacher Certification (MTTC) Cognitive Impairment subject-area test: secondary-level certified teachers must also pass the MTTC Elementary Education Test.
(The 500 and 600-level courses required for this endorsement may be used toward the Master of Arts in Teaching - Special Education degree program. All coursework toward a graduate degree must be completed within a seven year period.)
