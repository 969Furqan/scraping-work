History Department
The Department of History offers a major and a minor in history. Students considering taking history courses should observe the  following definitions:
100 ­ Broad surveys (suitable for all students)
200 ­ Specialized surveys (suitable for all students)
300 ­ Intensive studies (suitable for Seniors, Juniors and Sophomores who have completed at least one history course)
All students should consult their departmental advisor to plan a program of study to fit their individual, personal and career objectives. A history major is excellent preparation for professional post-graduate training in business and law schools. Students with these career goals should seek additional guidance from the departmental chairperson.
SERVICE LEARNING
SVSU students address the needs of local and global communities through the integration of meaningful service and traditional instruction that incorporates reflection and critical thinking to enrich the learning experience.
