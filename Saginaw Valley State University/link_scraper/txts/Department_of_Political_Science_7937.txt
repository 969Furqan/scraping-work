Department of Political Science
The study of politics is an examination of the processes and institutions through which humans create a common life. Ancient and modern political scientists have shown us that politics also is the study of the ideas, interests and expectations people bring to making decisions, and the obstacles they meet in their efforts to forge a common life that will be good for more than a few. This department in particular is concerned with issues of equality and justice. And we feel that it is important for citizens to understand the complexities of politics because governing rarely is a simplistic process.
The course offerings for this major reflect four traditional areas of political study: political theory, American political institutions, public policy, and international relations. Additionally, our program helps students understand the process of analyzing politics through exposure to research methods in the discipline.
A major in political science is appropriate background for students interested in careers in
law
,
political work
for public or private organizations from the local to the national level,
journalism, and teaching
. The major also can prepare students for graduate studies in fields such as law, public policy, and political science; or for interdisciplinary studies such as the Master of Arts Public Administration offered by Saginaw Valley State University.
